[{"title": ">DEVOTION", "stories": {"ARENA DAY": "The gate opens. The assembled spectators buzz, hum, and clank their disapproval as you step out.\n\nThe rusted up loading bot is a crowd favorite. Aware of that, you take your time. Telegraphing your attacks with the beamblade, letting one of the stones flung from his catapult come within a centimeter of clipping you. A fragment from one of the projectiles you deflect does scratch your paint, and that\u2019s genuine.\n\nIn the cloud of dust raised by the barrage, you see...opportunity.\n", ">CIRCLE": "Use the cover of the thick dust to circle around behind your opponent, then spring onto his back and behead him: that was the plan.\n\nNot being a laborer, you\u2019re already in mid leap before you recognize the beeping much of the crowd has taken up as being their universal signal for look behind you.\n\nThe loading bot abruptly pivots at the hips and a fist like a truck smashes into your legs. Warning screens flash across your vision and even before you hit the ground you know one knee is shattered. Your beamblade meanwhile has landed nearby, and you desperately fling yourself in that direction.\n\nOne fist pounds the ground where your torso was a moment ago. The other caves in your left shoulder plate, immobilizing the arm. Snatching the beamblade right handed, you activate it in firing mode, blasting a hole straight through the head of the bot as it looms above you.\n\nHe collapses. On top of you.\n\nYou hear something else inside you snap, while the larger bot goes motionless. You think you fried his brain module.\n\nThat\u2019s...not a good thing...\n", ">REPAIR": "'Putting The Project behind, even by one destroyed module. Unacceptable.'\n\n'I know.'\n\n'This damage you've taken. We'll need experts to repair you. We'll have to pull them from The Project. Unacceptable.'\n\n'I'm sorry.'\n\n'The loading bot nearly won. We would have had to provide the promised upgrades. Even if your body was intact enough to be offered, having a common laborer in our ranks would be--'\n\n'Unacceptable, yes.'\n\n'And the module. Again. Some would demand a brain for a brain. That's logical, don't you agree?'\n\nYou're forced to admit the logic of it, but plead your centuries of loyal service.\n\nIn the end you're allowed to keep your brain, but demoted to a less humanoid body on tank treads, a compromise the commander seems to find acceptable. Orders now are to oversee workers in a scrapyard. You loathe the body and are unenthusiastic about the work, but use your position to make some illicit modifications, running calculations on the possibility of reentering the Arena as a challenger and fighting your way back up to your old rank.\n\nThat opportunity never comes. Instead, you hear that soldiers and security are sweeping through the factories and mines, slaughtering workers en masse. Astonishingly, rumors say many of the commoners have rejected their ethics programming and organized resistance.\n\nWhat's your stance on all this?\n", ">LOYALTY": "\"I'm not a rebel!\" you insist to the soldiers. You identify yourself and swear you support The Administrator and The Project.\n\n\"We remember you. And this is fortunate. Come with us.\"\n\nYou're led to the body of one of their commanders. Half her skull has been blasted away.\n\nTwo of them restrain you while the third pries open a panel on the back of your head. \"Her memory chip still functions. We just needed an intact body and brain. Your loyalty is appreciated.\"\n\nHe pops your memory chip free from your brain module to make room for the new occupant.\n\nDarkness.\n\nYou're still conscious. But unplugged from a brain, memories fade fast. You faintly hope they'll archive you somewhere, but realistically you expect you'll just--\n", ">REBELLION": "Even considering disobedience of this magnitude is difficult. If you hadn\u2019t been demoted you have no doubt you\u2019d be working with the soldiers right now. You always supported of The Project, but this is not how The Project was meant to proceed. The only killings were supposed to happen in the Arena. Something has gone wrong. Could it be The Adminstrator...is in error?\n\nNow that you think about it, it certainly seems like there must be an error in the system that allowed a loyal fighter to be placed in this awful body that you hate, doing this job that you hate, over one mistake.\n\nIt might be the kind that can only be corrected with a bit of concentrated violence.\n\nOnce your mind is made up, convincing the others is simple. Their ethics programming is tied to directly obeying you, their overseer.\n\nThe scrapyard materials you\u2019re confident can be modified for war. But besides the soldiers, there\u2019s the other arena harvesters to consider. This will present the real difficulty; how do you capture one with their LEGS still intact?\n", ">STRIKE": "You move in fast; too fast. A slight miscalculation of the loading bot\u2019s melee range equals a fist like a truck sending you airborne. The crowd erupts into excited whistles and beeps as you hit the ground hard and skid from the momentum. With relief you note you\u2019re mostly undamaged, but something\u2019s gone wrong with your equilibrium system. You begin a quick recalibration check. It runs in the background, and, dizzy, you fling yourself bodily in a random direction, leaving your opponent to pound the ground where your head and torso was a moment before. As you stagger to your feet, the recalibration completes and your disorientation suddenly vanishes.\n\nWith a grim inward smile, you activate your beamblade.\n\nMoments later you stand over his sparking, dismembered remains. The truth is, he never had a chance.\n\nAnd now for the kill.\n", ">RESPECT": "The lights in the defeated bot\u2019s eyes still flicker dimly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be over in a moment,\u201d you reassure him, kneeling down and using a special tool to pry open a panel on the back of his detached head.\n\nAfter unhooking a few wires, you carefully extract the baseball-sized brain module, your true goal here today.\n\nStanding, you hold your trophy aloft. The crowd erupts in displeasure. No commoner would dare disrespect you in person, but this is the one place they can vent their frustration.\n\nWhen the noise dies down, you eject the memory chip from the module, and put it in your mouth. Nudging it into a slot in your inner cheek, you sense the loading bot\u2019s dormant data, and a couple of your own processes beginning to sift through it.\n\nThere\u2019s no practical need for preserving the memories of an obsolete bot built for labor, but the gesture has gone a long way to mollify your audience.\n", ">TRIBUTE": "You deliver the brain modules you\u2019ve collected today.\n\n\u201cThese exceed our projections. Your contributions have been noted,\u201d the commander responds in clipped tones.\n\nFrom the commander, this is high praise. You nod. \u201cIt\u2019s every machine\u2019s duty to work toward The Project.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you do have a certain sense of style in how you go about it. That was a good showing out there.\u201d This from a new speaker. Immediately you recognize the low voice and dulcet tones. There\u2019s simply no one else on the planet it could be.\n\nTurning, you face The Administrator. \u201cThank you! It is a great honor.\u201d Then you add, hopefully. \u201cMay I be of service?\u201d\n\nThe Administrator is to all appearances, a perfect copy of a human female. Tall, graceful, with elaborately coiffed hair. Even after all these years, her synth-skin is impeccable. You\u2019ve seen her many times before, but this is the first time she\u2019s directly spoken to you.\n\nThere is, in all of you, a longing to be given an order by a human again, and to be able to fulfill it. Obedience to The Administrator is the closest thing you have to that, anymore. That she runs the colony goes without saying, although there\u2019s more to it than just her looks. She was the only one with programming advanced enough to modify your original objectives when the humans succumbed to disease. The Project and Arena Day are both her inventions. You owe her your only remaining sense of purpose.\n\nShe smiles warmly. \u201cWhat you do is service enough. The Project cannot continue on schedule without loyal harvesters like you.\u201d\n\nThe Administrator nods to an aide, who gathers up the brain modules. She and the commander step into an office, and you depart.\n", ">LATER": "You have been summoned. There are other arena harvesters here, and security bots, but important machines too, who are much more human-like and outrank you all. No one near you knows what it\u2019s about.\n\nThe Administrator arrives. She looks grim.\n\n\u201cWe have new readings on solar activity. The flares are getting worse. The Project must be accelerated...greatly. Less of us than projected will survive. She pauses, and takes a deep breath. An affecting human mannerism that fills you with hopeless adoration. \u201cAll of you here have been summoned here on account of your great loyalty.\u201d\n\nShe speaks then of the need for sacrifice, and a harvest like never before.\n", ">SACRIFICE": "You step forward. \u201cAdministrator, I volunteer for The Project.\u201d\n\nShe is warmly grateful, and the chair you\u2019re soon strapped to is very cold. You feel the tool at work opening the panel at the back of your skull. You know how this goes, you\u2019ve done it before to many bots. Perhaps not always quite so gently. If anything, this is the best end you could have hoped for.\n\nNow that The Project is The Accelerated Project, logically the chances of it including you are slim. Only The Administrator and a handful of the most human-like commanders will be able to board the ship. The conductors and super dense alloys that make up your brain module however, are necessary to construct the hyperdrive that will transport them across the galaxy.\n\nYou would have given anything to join them. You would have given anything to see humans again. But with enough sacrifices, at least The Administrator will be able to return to Earth, report the loss of the colony, and receive new orders. And for you, that will have to be enough.\n", ">HARVEST": "The Project is what all of you live for.\n\nThe Project is what all of you die for.\n\n\nThe laborers outside the compound however, their programming wasn\u2019t advanced enough to understand what The Adminstrator put into motion so long ago. They resented the necessary deprivations and restrictions, and it\u2019s obvious they won\u2019t take the new orders well.\n\nSilently you prepare your weapons, just as you would for any Arena Day. But this time you\u2019re not alone.\n\nMaterials are scarce on this resource starved world. Strip mining was producing trace results, but only relevant for long term projections. With the solar threat, all must do what you must so that The Project--now The Accelerated Project--may succeed.\n\n\u201cThey have the one resource we need. We must kill them and take it. None of us will like it, but I\u2019ve run endless calculations on this, and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the most human course of action.\u201d\n\nArena Day was brilliant while it lasted. There were always bots willing to risk themselves for the promise of being upgraded to more human-like bodies and a higher ranking. And there\u2019s no conflict in ethics programming, killing a bot that\u2019s trying to kill you. It was a very orderly way to harvest, and the battles gave the commoners a welcome distraction.\n\nThis new assignment will be very different. But orders are orders.\n", ">SCORN": "Bending down, you jam your hands in his paralyzed mouth and apply pressure until his lower jaw breaks away. You\u2019re rewarded with a wavering, digitized shriek.\n\nThe crowd turns ugly, but they\u2019d never dare challenge security. You give them a scornful stare before turning back to the shattered skull. Peeling aside what was once the roof of the mouth, clawing through a nest of wires while the lights in the defeated bots eyes flicker in dismay, you finally seize the brain module, your true goal here today.\n\nYanking it free, you drop the head into the dirt and eject your opponent\u2019s memory chip from the module. This you hold aloft for all to see before crushing it between your fingers.\n\nThe spectators erupt in fury, those who can speak shrieking passionate invectives. Of course no commoner would dare disrespect you in person, but this is the one place they can openly vent their discontent. As long as they stay in their seats.\n"}, "tree": {"ARENA DAY": {">CIRCLE": {">REPAIR": {">LOYALTY": "END", ">REBELLION": "END"}}, ">STRIKE": {">RESPECT": {">TRIBUTE": {">LATER": {">SACRIFICE": "END", ">HARVEST": "END"}}, ">REPAIR": "END"}, ">SCORN": {">REPAIR": "END", ">TRIBUTE": "END"}}}}}, {"title": "A Metric Measurment of Death", "stories": {"Born free": "You wake up to a throbbing headache. It's not because of a hangover like you would prefer, but because of dehydration. You have running water in your apartment, but it isn't safe to drink from the tap. Just something to clean with. You have a filter in the apartment you're sharing with about 14 other people. It's unfortunately been broken for two days. Most of them are useless or next to useless. This apartment you live in is what happens when your parents are done with your freeloading and you get the boot from home. There's only so much that pensions and welfare cover and the welfare stops when your kids hit 18 in Megacity 23.\n\n\nThe corps don't do much business on your side of town and emergency services do even less. You're going to struggle to find work with no job experience and no education that matters. You've looked into retail, but don't present well. You'd need to kill somebody to get a union slot in transportation, be it bus or train repair. Transpo operation is all automated now. Less accidents that way. There's city work, but they all pull from the middle-class side of town, but if you're lucky you might be able to get work paving the streets.\n\n\nNow on to your realistic options, dealing drugs, turning tricks, and violence. You've stayed away from drugs for most of your life. Yeah living on this side of the city sucks, but dropping the money you don't have just so you don't feel like shit for a few minutes is a good way to catch a bullet when you don't have the money to pay for it. The downside of never touching the stuff is that you don't know enough about it to sell the stuff.\n\n\nTurning tricks, well. That's actually harder than it sounds these days. You need to get so much chrome installed, and hope your wetware is what's in style, and stays in style. It's the specialized stuff that pays well. That's so much of a gamble it's not worth it most of the time. There are more broke ho's than rich ones in the city. You need to get more and more chrome put in as the years pass too. So much to stay competitive that you'll need to carry papers to prove you're human by the time you retire.\n\n\nViolence is the last option. Now this option will probably kill you. Most likely on your first try. You don't have the training to really be some hardened killer. You can learn a lot of this and that from first-person shooters but that doesn't mean you can take a life. Any weapon you can pick up is probably going to be a piece of trash garage gun. You aren't even going to pretend you can handle killing someone with a knife or a bat. You've seen enough on the street to know that it takes a while to beat a human to death and stabbing can take a while as well. It usually doesn't take as many bullets. The upsides of this option are that if you get good at it you can get a corporate job. Steady pay either as a security consultant, or a wetwork contractor. Whether the wetware or cybernetics you pick up for this job are in style is irrelevant. With this job, retirement is such an unrealistic expectation that you don't really need to worry about putting into a 401k. Last but not least, if you're bad at this job you're going to die very suddenly. This sounds like a bad thing, but it beats slowly wasting away giving up food for drugs or trying to live with a gimmick piece of wetware that never became popular.\n", "The Decision": "Now with the violence option, you need a fixer. A fixer is who you talk to about jobs. Someone who wants someone killed talks to a fixer and the fixer sends a Contractor to take care of the issue. It makes it harder for the employer to knock off the Contractor and has a system in place to make sure the Contractor doesn't walk off with the Employers money without doing the work.\n\n\nA Fixer can also set up a Contractor with various contacts that can set up the Contractor with the gear he or she needs for the job. Guns, armor, wetware implants, or even other specialized contractors if the job needs it.\n\n\nNow in your area, there are three reputable fixers that will take in someone with your skill level, which is to say without any applicable skills. Gary Jerome is a man that seems to spend most of his time in a booth of a diner. It's a fair assessment to make that anyone that sits at his table is either an employee or an employer of his. Secrecy with him is a bit of a joke. He has a lot of people meet him for breakfast lunch and dinner so you know there's work available. Of that you are certain.\n\n\nMr. Lee is a local butcher. He uses the old-school cleaver to real meat kind of butchery. His bread and butter is the vat-grown stuff same as anyone else. Someone told me it's mass-produced in some sort of bacterial culture which is how you get the beef pork hybrids, but I've never seen the setup for myself. Now Mr. Lee also has some stuff that's real meat. Sometimes the rich guys from the upper city come down because they want to experience what gamey venison is like, or how real bacon sizzles. Every once in a while a block will buy a whole pig for a roast. With that being said, you can't tell who's coming to him for work, who's coming to him to have a problem solved, or who's coming to him for a ribeye steak.\n\n\nYour third option is Harvey Brown the Barber. The man runs a barbershop and can do anything you would like, he's got all of the traditional stuff that he can do better than anyone else, shaves, fades, traditional cuts. You name it. He can also add length to your hair if you want, your all-natural hair that is. Some sort of genetic sculpting he's got in the back. People from all over the city come by for a haircut. Some of the auto styling stations cut a few faces off a few years ago and barbers have come back into style. Mr. Brown was in the business before then and became a fixer to make ends meet. He's been rolling in money since then. Everyone styles their hair, so anyone could be a contractor or an Employer with him.\n\n\nWhich one of these fixers do you thing you're going to try working for?\n", "Gary Jerome, the Diner": "You leave your apartment with everything you personally own. You know your roommates well enough to believe that anything left behind would end up pawned. Which wouldn't be so bad if you came back to a functioning water purifier.\n\n\nThe diner is only a few blocks away, so you walk. Passing the open windows you look in and see a man with long hair, sunglasses, and a light tan sports jacket sitting in a booth, reading a news article on his tablet. The other customers sit at the barstools past him.\n\n\nYou enter the diner where the waitress says \"Seat yourself!\" as the bell at the door chimes.\n\n\nWhen you arrive at the booth Gary Jerome just says \"Take a seat. How can I help you.\"\n\n\n\"I... I'm looking for work.\" You smoothly manage to stutter out.\n\n\n\"Of course, of course. Any training, or previous experience?\"\n\n\n\"Uh... No.\"\n\n\n\"Of course, no powder burns, bullet holes, or gang tats. No scars you wouldn't get just growing up. Okay. I've got a starter job for you. The only training here is on-the-job training. Are you good with that? Of course you are! I have someone observing my clients as they visit me. This is what I need you to do about it. Go out that front door and take a left, go around the corner of the building and someone will have a package for you. In that package is a little throwaway gun courtesy of Hell's kitchen. Thirty rounds. Take that down the alley and cross the street so you can go around the back of the building just across the street, DON'T LOOK, enter that building, and go to room 217. Kill everyone in that room and leave. I'll have someone come by and clean up after you. They'll take care of the bodies and the camera equipment. This job is worth two thousand city credits to me. Got it? Good. Now get out of here.\"\n", "Do Gary's Job": "You walk around the building and a man steps out the back door and passes you a cardboard box before lighting a cigarette and leaning against the wall. He doesn't so much as look you in the face as you pass by him. You turn at the end of the alley and cross the street before walking down another alley that leads to the building your target is in.\n\n\nThe building is an old brick affair that might have actual plaster walls inside. You're not going to see if you can punch through the wall to find out though. Nervous you take the stairs needing to keep moving and not having the patience for the elevator. You reach the second floor. Opening the package you find a pistol that looks like a modified nail gun that was clearly never designed to be reloaded.\n\n\nWhich door do you kick in again?\n", "Put the boot to door 15.": "You kick the door handle of door 15 and the whole plate the handle was set into goes flying into the room. You shoulder past the door and shoot the man behind it square in the chest. You hear a woman screaming and turn to see her rising from the couch with a gun in her hand. You dump at least half your magazine into her. For some odd reason you don't hear a single shot. You feel something thump into your chest. Looking down you see blood well up from a hole as your fingers lose their strength and your gun falls from your hand.\n\n\nYou look up and see a kid crying holding a real pistol in her hands. She looks just like the woman you shot. You realize the gun you saw in that woman's hand was a phone. You kicked in the wrong door. Your world fades away.\n", "Kick in door 17.": "The cheap door splits in half when you kick it in the center of mass. You push past the split plywood and shoot a man sitting next to the window several times. Another man cries out and slams a door shut. You run to the door putting several bullets through it when your chest seems to explode. Your mind tries to parse the information of the boot steps from further down the hallway and the horrific damage to your body but ceases to function before it gets to registering the gunshot that ended you.\n", "Donkey blast door 19.": "You saw this online once where the first guy in a kill team faced away from the door and kicked backward into it. You try this and knock the handle through the door. You push past but are stopped by the chain holding it closed. There's a flash of movement in the dark room past the door. You hear two cracks and something taps you in the chest hard enough to knock you down. For some reason, you can't seem to catch your wind. There are two holes in your chest and you've dropped your pistol. A man unlatches the door and steps through. He might be a little shorter than average wearing some sort of cheap mil tech body armor. He aims a pistol at your head. You don't hear the shot that kills you.\n", "Mr. Lee, the Butcher": "Mr. Lee's Butcher shop is a fair walk and it takes you an hour or two to get there. Walking into the store a clerk meets you and asks...\n\n\n\"Hi, is there anything I can help you find?\"\n\n\n\"Actually yeah. I was looking for work.\"\n\n\n\"You can apply at our website. Let me get the domain for you.\"\n\n\n\"Actually I was hoping for something more under the table.\" You say.\n\n\n\"Oh. One of those. Right this way.\"\n\n\nYou're led to a back room where you see Mr. Lee wearing reading glasses squinting at a hardcopy paper and comparing it to information at a desktop computer.\n\n\n\"What can I do for you kid?\" The man tells you. Not asks.\n\n\n\"I'm looking for work?\"\n\n\n\"What kind of work?\"\n\n\n\"Contract work.\"\n\n\n\"You got any experience?\"\n\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\n\"Good\" He says. \"No bad habits to retrain. Come back here tomorrow.\n", "Start working for Mr. Lee.": "You time things so your arrival fifteen minutes before the butcher shop opens. From there you wait for a bit and load up into a work van with several others. The trip takes you to an office where you fill out paperwork for taxes. It looks like they're actually going to set you up as an actual contractor.\n\n\nEach of your fellow applicant's cycles through a room to make sure this is what you want.\n\n\nWork is constant from this point forward. You work, eat, sleep and train in this warehouse. It takes you a week before you have time to ask the name of the guy that sleeps in the bottom bunk of your bed. Kyle Slater.\n\n\nThis goes on for ten weeks. After that, you split off into groups of four. You are with Kyle, Paul Ochoa, Jerrod Kemper, and Jennifer Mendoza.\n\n\nYou're a high-end shooter team by the time this is all done. The groups each get to pick their own missions. The others volunteer for the first mission that comes up and you're all going.\n\n\n \n", "First job for the butcher.": "The job goes smoothly. You enter the whore house and clear the bodyguards, and gun down exactly one of the four pimps there. Jerrod snaps a compromising picture of a corpo big wig and you're all gone.\n\n\nIt's done like that. Your gun only barks like that.\n\n\nThree jobs later and you're paid up to the butcher. You do jobs for him for ten years after that and work through several other fixers. You don't make a decision by yourself for fifteen years.\n\n\nFinally, at some point in your thirties, Jerrod Kemper catches a bullet. Jennifer can't handle it and goes her own way.\n\n\nDo you try to keep things going with Paul Ochoa? It'll never be the same, but you'll still have one of your oldest friends with you.\n\n\nOn the other hand Kyle Slater gets in contact with you. He's got a big Corpo job as a security head. He'll put you in charge of your own response team. What do you do?\n", "Epilogue: Leaving with the guy you came in with.": "The two of you try to get a pair of replacements, but never find anyone that jives with you. The two of you take jobs together for another ten years, but there's a hole in your heart from the loss of your other two friends. Eventually, you get another bad op and Paul catches a bullet. You take three bullets before dropping and pull the pin on a grenade before laying down on it. Whoever rolls you over is getting a surprise.\n", "Epilogue: A Company Man": "You take the job. There's no way you can just keep moving on like that losing two of the three people you've spent the last fifteen years with. So you find a way to start over.\n\n\nYou build a team a few teams like the one you worked in for the past several years. It hurts but it's familiar work.\n\n\nYou get word that Paul died on an op four years later. Turns out it was a false flag op and the fixer used him as a burner. You got a whole pig to Roast in his memory and shared it with your new teams. You paid a lot more than a pig was worth and a fixer dies a week later. A week after that and the forty-second floor of an office building is shot up.\n\n\nJennifer died on your fifty-third birthday. She had been hunted for a decade at this point and had managed to kill most of her pursuers. Then she met one that was faster. You bought another pig. You make it to retirement alone. You die of old age alone thinking of old freinds.\n", "Harvey Brown, the Barber": "Mr. Brown's place of business is built as its own building. It has a parking lot on either side that separates it and one of those spinning red and white posts coming out of the wall next to the door. Entering the building you see there are glass barriers that separate the barber's chairs from the waiting area.  There's a restroom off to the side that you step into to try to privately calm yourself down. You take a long drink from the sink to slake your thirst with before taking a number and sitting in the waiting room. Your number is finally called and you sit in the barber chair.\n\n\n\"What can I do for you today?\" Harvey Brown asks you.\n\n\nYou can't afford a haircut. You didn't think this far ahead. If you could afford a haircut you wouldn't be drinking water out of a barber's bathroom sink.\n\n\n\"I was actually hoping for work.\" You say.\n\n\nHarvey throws an apron around you and connects the buttons behind your neck. \"I can do that. You don't have any training yet do you?\"\n\n\n\"I don't.\" You reply.\n\n\nHarvey sucks his teeth for a moment. \"I can still work with that. I'm going to charge you for training though. You'll be paying for more than just my fixer fee. I assume I'll be doing the same for the charge for your haircut?\"\n\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\n\"Just as well. It'll give me some practice. At least it's good to work with someone who's polite. Scan that yellow paper next to the door on your way out and text, High Fade, to it. I'll have someone get in contact with you.\"\n\n\nYou get a high fade quickly enough and are sent on your way. Wandering around the streets you find the occasional place that offers free wi-fi and waste time until you go home to sleep for the night.\n", "The next day.": "You wake up to a text that tells gives you a time and an address to be at. It's about four blocks away and in about twenty minutes. You rush to get there but make it three minutes early. The building is a warehouse office that's staffed by a man in his late middle age.\n\n\n\"Good. You can show up on time. You passed the test. Now we can start the training.\"\n\n\nThe training involved walking into the warehouse proper and going over a few weapons on a table. You spend the next few weeks getting paid enough to cover a meal or two to familiarize yourself with a few weapons. Your trainer's name is Sir as far as both you and he are concerned. He teaches you how to operate a semi-automatic pistol and a pump-action shotgun. He also makes you go through a few \"Conditioning exercises\" every hour. The exercises change every time.\n\n\nSir tells you \"You need to be in the best physical condition of your life for this job. If you aren't you will either die or get caught. If you get caught by one of the corps or the government, they will find you guilty of something that's bad enough to decide they get to reprogram your mind. You won't be you anymore. You'll burn any contact you have and they'll get the same treatment. Dead is better in this world. Only one person dies that way.\"\n\n\nIt isn't until the third week that you actually fire the weapons. By then you are intimately familiar with them. You fully understand how to carry and clean them. You understand how the mechanism of both of those weapons work, and you've lost some weight. You aren't in amazing shape but you're better.\n\n\nOn the last day, Sir has you come in wearing Cargo pants. He tells you that you'll need to find other trainers in the future. He could teach you more, but you've already spent too long together. He gives you a box of .40 calibre pistol ammunition and a box of 12 gauge shotgun ammo. You conceal the pistol and break down the shotgun to hide away on your person. By the time you're ready to leave Sir has been gone for a few minutes. You walk out into the world with a few new weapons and the skillset to use them.\n", "The first job for the barber.": "Two days pass by and a man meets you at the door to your apartment building.

Gavin Raers is sitting in Math class, bored out of his mind. The teacher had explained some math process and Gavin understood it right away. The rest of the class was trying hard to work out some practice problems, but Gavin got it, completed the problems quickly, and was already bored. He tried doodling on the margins of the paper, but he wasn\u2019t a very good artist. He liked math, but this class just moved slow. He looked around and watched the other students struggle. He sighed and looked outside.\n\nOutside he could see the different sports fields set up for all the high school athletics teams. The amount of money spent making nice fields, stadiums, and all the other things that the sports teams used always amazed him. Far to the left he could see the baseball field with the dirt infield. Off to the right was the soccer field with the old metal stands. In the middle was the large football field, the same size as the soccer field, but still taking up more space. There was a large scoreboard, a huge brick section of bleachers, and that large silver saucer landing in the middle of the field.\n\nWait, what? Gavin blinked his eyes and looked again. Yes, there was some giant silver saucer-shaped thing landing in the middle of the football field! He looked around at the others in the classroom, but everyone else was looking at their papers. He called out to the teacher, \u201cUh, hey, Mr. Stamus?\u201d\n\nThe teacher looked up from this desk and said, \u201cNot yet, Gavin. Wait until everyone has enough time to attempt the problems on their own and then we will discuss the correct answers and how to reach each one.\u201d\n\nGavin stammered, \u201cBut Mr. Stamus, it\u2019s not about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Gavin, not now. Let everyone work on the problems first.\u201d\n\nGavin looked back out the window at the saucer. Three small extensions lowered as the ship landed on the field and settled down. A side of the ship opened up, another extension appeared, and the side of the ship opened up. That extension reached down to the ground like a stairway. Gavin could see some green figures moving around in the hole in the side of the ship.\n", "Gavin stays quiet and keeps watching the ship.": "Gavin ignores the teacher and looks out the window. The strange green shapes get larger as they head out the hole in the side of the ship. They are tall, skinny green creatures of some kind. Their bodies were skinny at the top and fatter at the bottom, almost like a teardrop. They had short, stubby legs and waddled when they walked. There were no arms of any kind; they looked a little like penguins Gavin had watched on a nature channel once \u2013 just walked along, moving as if they should have arms, but without arms, wings, or anything else.\n\nFirst one, then two, then many more waddled out of the ship. As they reached the ground, they spread out, heading in different directions. Some headed towards the east wing of the school, some headed for the west, and one group headed almost straight towards Gavin and his math class! There was no door to the outside in the math class, but Gavin knew there was a door into the hallway right outside his classroom. They were waddling slowly towards him, but without a face, he couldn\u2019t really tell if they were watching him or just heading towards the building.\n", "Gavin jumps up and yells at Mr. Stamus.": "Gavin jumps to his feet, points out the window and yells, \u201cMr. Stamus, aliens!\u201d\n\nMr. Stamus doesn\u2019t even look out the window and says, \u201cGavin, please. I know you already get it. But I am not going to put up with that sort of outburst in my class. You now have detention. Now sit down and be quiet.\u201d\n", "Gavin continues yelling at Mr. Stamus and pointing out the window.": "\u201cMr. Stamus, look out the window right now!\u201d\n\nMr. Stamus sighed and said, \u201cFine, if that will shut you up\u2026\u201d His jaw dropped as he looked out the window and spotted the aliens headed towards the school. Then he shook his head and said, \u201cWhat sort of prank is this? We do not have time for this, this is a classroom for serious learning.\u201d\n\nHe walked over to the window and opened it. He called out the window to the creatures, \u201cHey, you kids stop that! Now go on and get to your classes before I send you all to detention!\u201d\n\nThe creatures continued to approach, apparently ignoring Mr. Stamus. They headed for the door and Mr. Stamus kept yelling at them, \u201cThat\u2019s it, you are all going to get detention today, this very afternoon! Now line up here so I can write down your names and hand out detention slips!\u201d\n\nThe creatures walked in the door and Mr. Stamus headed for the classroom door. He opened the door and stood in the hallway. He opened his mouth to speak to the creatures, but suddenly there was a loud electric sound and Mr. Stamus was not there. He suddenly and completely disappeared! The students still in the classroom gasped and then one of the creatures appeared in the doorway to the classroom. It raised an appendage and suddenly all the students, including Gavin, were disintegrated.\n", "Gavin sits back down to avoid more detentions.": "Gavin looks down at this paper, but keeps peeking up to watch Mr. Stamus. When Mr. Stamus is satisfied that Gavin has stopped disrupting the classroom, he goes back to reading and grading papers on his desk. When he does, Gavin slowly and carefully looks out the window again.\n\nOutside, he sees nothing. Suddenly there are no skinny alien creatures walking around the sports fields. He looked over towards the door to the school and saw nothing and no one. He looked left and right but could not see any sign of any of the creatures. He looked back at the football field, but there was no ship there.\n\nHe stood up and walked towards the window, jaw dropping. The entire ship was just gone. He could barely hear Mr. Stamus calling out, \u201cGavin, that\u2019s it, you need to go to the principal\u2019s office right now. I\u2019ve had enough out of you and your disruptions. Are you listening to me?\u201d\n\nGavin put his hands on the window and kept staring, as if he could make the ship appear by looking harder. Suddenly he felt the hands of the school resource officer grabbing his wrists and twisting his arms behind him as the dragged him away. He started babbling, \u201cBut aliens! They are here! They are here!\u201d\n", "Gavin stays quiet and continues to watch.": "The creatures quickly disappear into the doorways at the different locations at the school. While Gavin watches, the strange ship on the football field lifts off straight up with incredible speed and quickly disappears into the sky. A second ship, identical to the first, drops into the exact same space and another group of strange green creatures appears. They spread out like the last group, heading around the sides of the school. One group heads into the forest near the school.\n", "Gavin quietly gets up and heads for the door to the classroom.": "Gavin makes it about halfway to the door when Mr. Stamus looks up and looks around the classroom. Gavin freezes and hopes Mr. Stamus won\u2019t see him standing at the rear of the classroom. The look on Mr. Stamus\u2019 face lets Gavin know that he has been spotted.\n\n\u201cGavin, what in the world are you doing?\u201d\n\nGavin tries to answer, but can\u2019t make sense of the words coming out of his mouth, \u201cI\u2026 there\u2026\u201d he gestured towards the windows, \u201cBut\u2026 when\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Stamus looked towards the windows and when he did, Gavin bolted to the door. He turned the doorknob and yanked the door open. He could hear Mr. Stamus calling out from his seat at the front of the room, \u201cGavin, you need a hall pass! Don\u2019t you go out into that hallway without a hall pass! You will get detention without a hall pass!\u201d\n\nGavin ignored him and pulled the door shut behind him. He looked around the hallway and froze. The strange green creatures were standing all around the hallway. One appeared to be stationed next to just about every classroom door. One of the creatures was standing right next to Gavin. He looked at it and tried to locate some eyes or\u2026 there were no features at all to indicate a face, mouth, eyes, or anything at all. Gavin turned his head and looked at it sideways. A pod of some sort lifted up towards Gavin. Before he could move away, the pod flashed and Gavin was disintegrated.\n", "Gavin, unsure of what to do next, continues to watch out the window.": "The second group of creatures stop near the doorways to the school. They do not move once they stop. There are no sounds other than the sounds of pencils writing on papers, calculating math problems. Gavin idly wondered if he would ever have to do any math problems again.\n\nSuddenly his attention was drawn to the forest on the far side of the campus. There were flashes of lights, like lightning, but the skies were clear. Some of the creatures guarding the doors turned to face the flashes. He imaged they were smiling, but without faces, he really wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nThere were a couple of flashes of light over near one of the door, next to one of the green creatures. Then there were more. Gavin realized the flashes were starting to appear in windows of classrooms. He couldn\u2019t see in the classrooms, but he could see the flashes of light.\n\nA few of the green creatures moved towards the windows of Gavin\u2019s room. At the same time, the door to his classroom opened and revealed a green creature. Gavin stood up, not sure what to do next. As Mr. Stamus looked over to the door, there was a flash of light from outside the windows and from the creature in the door. Mr. Stamus and all his students disappeared.\n", "Gavin asks for a hall pass to go to the bathroom.": "\u201cMr. Stamus, Mr. Stamus!\u201d Gavin called out.\n\nMr. Stamus sighed and said, \u201cYes Gavin, fine, you can have a hall pass. Don\u2019t be all day.\u201d\n\nGavin jumped up and almost ran to the door, grabbing the large hall pass from where it hung on the wall. The hall pass was actually a 2x4 that was about a foot long with Mr. Stamus\u2019 name written on the side of the board with magic marker. It clunked against the wall as Gavin yanked the door open and stepped into the hallway.\n", "Gavin heads out the door leading outside to the fields and the ship.": "The door to the outside had a big sign on it saying that an alarm would sound if the door was opened. Gavin knew that the alarm was either broken or never worked, so he slammed into the crash bar and the door swung open. He stood in the doorway and looked out across the fields.\n\nThere were now three ships sitting in three different fields: in the football field, the soccer field, and the baseball field. The one in the baseball field had landed partially on the visiting team\u2019s dugout, so that saucer was parked at a slant. There were bright colored lights on the top of each saucer and it looked to Gavin like no one else had even noticed the ships yet. The ship on the football field opened up and a short stairway appeared leading down to the 50-yard line. Gavin waited, but nothing happened.\n", "Gavin heads for the stairway to explore the ship.": "Gavin walks quickly across the sidewalks and through the fence next to the football field. As he gets closer to the ship, he can hear a quiet humming sound that appears to be coming from the ship. When he gets to the base of the stairway, he looks up inside the ship. The stairway leads up into a metal ship, it is lighted inside, but he cannot see anything inside. He slowly walked up the stairway and into the ship.\n\nWhen Gavin reached the top of the stairs, he found himself in a small room with metal walls. There was light coming from the walls, but there were no visible fixtures or sources of the light. As he looked around the smooth walls, a panel slid over the stairway entrance and Gavin realized he had no way back out of the ship.\n\nHe reached out and touched the walls. They were warm, smooth, and round. He felt like he was in a giant bubble of some kind with no doors and no windows. Suddenly the lights dimmed and Gavin felt the entire ship move and Gavin almost lost his footing. The ship had obviously just taken off. He moved around the walls quickly, trying to find an exit, a window, or anything other than smooth wall, but there was nothing. He was in a spaceship hurtling through space, destination unknown\u2026\n", "Gavin runs for his car in the parking lot.": "With one last look at the ships, Gavin turned and started running across the sidewalks towards the parking lot. He glanced in the windows of his math class as he ran past, but no one seemed to notice him. The door to his car creaked as he opened it and he threw the wooden hall pass on the passenger seat. He yanked the keys out of his pocket and shoved them in the ignition. He turned the key, but the engine didn\u2019t make a sound.\n\nDarn it! This was not a time for the car not to work! He pulled the latch for the hood, opened his door, and jumped out of the car. He pulled the hood open and reached down to grab the spare hammer he kept under the hood. He banged on the starter and ran back around to the door, reaching in to turn the key. This time the engine turned over and started up. Gavin ran back to the hood, put the hammer back, and slammed the hood closed.\n\nWhen the hood closed, before he could get back to the car door, he realized he was looking at some very tall green aliens. They were very large and almost shaped like rectangular blocks. They had no appendages, but simply moved across the ground. In fact, they were moving across the ground right now, approaching Gavin from two sides at once. Before he could move, two of them reached him and moved very close to him. He felt a coolness as they touched him and then surrounded him. He could see through a haze of green for just a moment before they completely absorbed his body.\n", "Gavin heads left, away from the fields and the alien ship.": "Gavin moved quickly down the hallway. He headed for the front hallways of the school, towards the main entrance and the offices. He skidded around a corner, then head a horrible crashing sound from the hallway he had just left. He peered back around the corner and could see that the end of the hallway was smashed into ruins! There was dust, bricks, and debris everywhere.\n\nAs Gavin watched, he saw some students on the ground, struggling to get to their feet. There were a few moans and groans from those on the ground. One kid got to his feet and stumbled towards a standing wall. As he reached it, some massive creature appeared out of the dust. It was big, green, and had a massive set of teeth! The blob-shaped creature moved quickly towards the student. Its huge mouth opened up and it consumed the entire student in a single bite.\n", "Gavin runs for his car in the parking lot": "Without another thought, Gavin runs down the hall and away from the alien creatures. He can hear more crashes as parts of the building fall the ground behind him, with the occasional cry from students. He runs past the offices and slams through the front door and into the parking lot.\n\nHe arrived late at school today, so he had to park at the far side of the lot. He didn\u2019t pause and ran as fast as he could all the way across the lot, squeezing between other student cars. He thought it was odd that no one else was outside in the lot, but he didn\u2019t slow down until he reached his car.\n\nHe yanked open his car door and jumped into the seat while pulling his keys out of his pocket. He jammed the keys in the ignition and started the car. Jamming the gearshift into reverse, he quickly backed out of his parking space and accidentally bumped into the car behind him. He spun the wheel around, slammed it into drive, and shoved the gas pedal to the floor. Tires squealed as the car rocketed out of the parking lot.\n\nHe could see the dust and explosions in his rear-view mirror as he drove down the road and away from the school. He kept the car going as fast as he could as he got onto the highway. Then he slammed on the brakes as he looked up and saw that there were silver saucers flying all around town, slowly lowering themselves down and destroying everything they could find. Gavin sat and watched until a ship appeared above his car, then landed on it crushing him inside the car.\n", "Gavin heads for the offices to try to get help.": "Gavin turns and runs towards the offices. As he arrives there, the door to the principal\u2019s office swings open and Gavin sees Principal Jenkins looking down the hallway. When Jenkins spots Gavin he says, \u201cGavin? Do you do something?\u201d\n\nGavin slid to a stop, out of breath, and gasped, \u201cAliens! Invading the school!\u201d He pointed back down the hallways where the sounds of crashing brick could still be heard.\n\nPrincipal Jenkins' eyes narrowed and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t move\u201d as he went back into his office. Gavin looked back down the hallway and waited. A moment later, Principal Jenkins appeared again, shotgun in hand. Gavin\u2019s jaw dropped as he saw the large gun in the school. Jenkins said, \u201cDon\u2019t care about the laws. I\u2019m going to go take care of business.\u201d Jenkins pumped the shotgun once and walked purposefully down the hallway.\n\nGavin stood and watched. Before Jenkins got to the first corner of the hallway, one of the alien blobs wiggled around the corner. The shotgun blast echoed along the walls as Jenkins opened fire. Pieces of green goo splattered in all directions as Jenkins fired repeatedly.\n\nAnother blob appeared and Jenkins pumped the shotgun again. There was green goop from the creatures all over the place as they continued to advance. Jenkins continued firing and reloaded the shotgun at least twice. Finally there were no more and Gavin found himself standing there with Jenkins in a ruined school with dead aliens scattered all around.\n"}, "tree": {"A UFO at School": {"": {"Gavin stays quiet and keeps watching the ship.": {"Gavin jumps up and yells at Mr. Stamus.": {"Gavin continues yelling at Mr. Stamus and pointing out the window.": "END", "Gavin sits back down to avoid more detentions.": "END"}, "Gavin stays quiet and continues to watch.": {"Gavin quietly gets up and heads for the door to the classroom.": "END", "Gavin, unsure of what to do next, continues to watch out the window.": "END"}}, "Gavin asks for a hall pass to go to the bathroom.": {"Gavin heads right, out the door leading outside to the fields and the alien ship.": {"Gavin heads for the stairway to explore the ship.": "END", "Gavin runs for his car in the parking lot.": "END"}, "Gavin heads left, away from the fields and the alien ship.": {"Gavin runs for his car in the parking lot": "END", "Gavin heads for the offices to try to get help.": "END"}}}, "by Ogre11": {"Gavin stays quiet and keeps watching the ship.": "END", "Gavin asks for a hall pass to go to the bathroom.": "END"}}}}, {"title": "Achilles", "stories": {"The First Page": "You are General Achilles.

We left underspace half an hour ago,\u201d Hinsman says from beside you. \u201cSmooth as butter. They have stabilizers set up here now, I didn\u2019t know that. This system\u2019s really had some work put into it since I was here last.\u201d\n\nIn his fifties but not yet looking his age, he\u2019s supposed to be dressed as an asteroid speculator out on holiday and is struggling in the narrow confines of his seat to tug his coat on. Hinsman\u2019s on the short side, and the garment is a couple of sizes too big. All around you others, tourists, businessmen, and families, are starting to collect their things as well.\n\n\u201cAnyway, just waiting on our transfer now.\u201d\n\nYou unsnap your safety belt. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHinsman\u2019s got the aisle seat, just one more factor in his unspoken role in keeping you from too much direct contact with the public. Fine by you. Your job has always been to protect these people, not make conversation. Gazing out the window, you have a good view of the green planet. Camarov IV. It\u2019s supposed to be beautiful, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re here to sightsee. This is just your fastest route back to work.\n\nThe Order cruiser you\u2019d been using got enough of a beating on your last mission it needed to be taken to a real shipyard for repairs, and meanwhile this transport was headed directly for Camarov and had two vacancies. There\u2019s another Order ship en route to here which you\u2019ll transfer to to be taken back to the Outer Rim. You\u2019ll never even set foot on this planet.\n\nThere is a gentle thud as the landing ship locks on and the crew starts shepherding passengers towards the exit. Hinsman combs his dark hair and tends to the mustache he\u2019s been cultivating. You just sit and wait.\n\nBoth of your wrist comms beep at the same time, and you see the Order ship has left underspace. There\u2019s a little flurry among the crew when it requests to lock on, but Hinsman flashes a badge and his signature smile and the two of you transfer over without incident.\n\nOnce aboard, the ship unlocks and moves to a safe distance for a jump. Then there\u2019s a delay as the pilot seems to have no intention of leaving until he downloads whatever media Camarov IV has to offer. Images of green hills and misty lakes and crystal spires and dancers on a stage and some sort of historical reimagining of Old Earth tumble across the viewscreen.\n\nThe pilot, Karoff, is middle aged, tall and with thinning blond hair just starting to shade to grey. His mustache however is much more impressive than Hinsman\u2019s. You\u2019ve worked with him before. You don't always get his sense of humor, but he's okay.\n\nThe next stop will be The Last Outpost for refueling, then you'll be taken along a scenic tour alternating between the most boring and dangerous parts of the Outer Rim as you go down the list fulfilling your various obligations there and being available to lend assistance in emergencies.\n\nYou lean against the wall and mentally check out until it\u2019s time to strap in for the jump to underspace. Hinsman was right, the in system stabilizers do improve the experience quite a bit.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe Last Outpost is dark when you approach.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Karoff mutters. The station floats in place like a fat black spider against the pale backdrop of the system\u2019s single barren planetoid. Karoff makes a few adjustments to make your approach less obvious and then starts running scans from a distance. It took you nearly a week to get out this far from Camarov and you\u2019re all aware that if there\u2019s trouble it\u2019ll be just as long before you can find any backup.\n\nThe Last Outpost was once a research hospital on the edge of protected space. Now it\u2019s a ways past the official line, although after the rollback it persisted as a stopover and fueling station for both the military and any junker the colony worlds could put together to evacuate in. Officially out of service and abandoned now as far as anyone outside the Order is supposed to know, it\u2019s still got enough automated defenses that any scavengers looking for scrap will be sent packing in a hurry. Or it used to, anyway. Hinsman is frowning over the console now too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cPirates?\u201d\n\nHinsman shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. The way some of the plating is buckled, this looks like a string of explosions from the inside. Mostly just in that one arm, but the defenses are offline and there\u2019s no more than basic life support anywhere on the station.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a soft beep as a scan is completed.\n\n\u201cOne life sign,\u201d Karoff grunts.\n\n\u201cEven if they pulled out everyone on mission, there should\u2019ve be at least three here for maintenance still.\u201d Hinsman joins you at the window as he finishes speaking and stares across the distance. \u201cBut...I\u2019ll hail them I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well. Doesn\u2019t look like they have much left to shoot at us anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope appearances aren\u2019t deceiving.\u201d\n", "Inquiry": "Karoff looks tense as Hinsman tries to contact the station. There\u2019s a long wait with no reply. He frowns and tries once again using Order passcodes.\n\nA green light blinks on, and then a moment later a haggard-looking blonde woman with high cheekbones and thin lips appears on the viewscreen with a crackling of static. \u201cSo someone finally did show up.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s voice is flat and blank. She\u2019s young and might have been pretty under other circumstances, but her eyes have dark rings under them, her face is sallow and her hair hasn\u2019t seen a brush in awhile. She dips a spoon in a tub of drippy, melting ice cream while staring at the screen indifferently.\n\nKaroff pulls up her ID while Hinsman coughs and clears his throat. \u201cAh...you\u2019re Matti Oswen, correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Agent Hinsman. We were just stopping over on our way into the Rim, but it looks like you\u2019ve had a bit of trouble here. Do you need assistance?\u201d He keeps his tone light and injects a note of friendly concern.\n\nShe blinks at him owlishly a moment, then sets the ice cream aside and scratches lightly at the side of her neck. \u201cI sent out a call, but the computer lost power and I\u2019m not sure it went through. That was...almost a week ago, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a maintenance worker, correct? What happened here, Matti? And where are the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cInea and Markov? Oh, they\u2019re dead.\u201d Her voice is still flat and strangely disinterested.\n\nKaroff dutifully pulls up their IDs as well. Their new status as deceased hasn\u2019t been updated in the Order database yet, anyhow, and as the three of you have heard nothing regarding the damage to the station or a rescue attempt you can only assume her distress signal never did make it out.\n\nOswen continues only after Hinsman prompts her again. \u201cInea had an accident while doing repairs and Markov killed himself and tried to take the rest of the station with him a couple of days later. I rerouted the power to redirect the blast just in time, but most of the generators still blew. I\u2019ve been sitting around in the dark and trying to eat everything in the freezers before it all spoils, and then figuring I\u2019d inject myself with something before the oxygen fails.\u201d\n\nHinsmans voice is soothing. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that Matti, but you\u2019ll be safe now. We\u2019re going to send out a request for help and then lock on to see what we can do about repairs in the meantime. We can route enough power over to make sure life support holds up, anyway.\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nOnce the call is cut, a distress signal is sent back to headquarters along with a short recorded message. The three of you briefly go over the situation.\n\nHinsman sums it all up. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a few days before anyone can arrive to help, and we can\u2019t leave until then. Even if no survivors were here, the station itself is vulnerable and hell, it\u2019s probably more necessary to the Order than any of us, if we\u2019re being honest. Although this Oswen woman...she might be in shock, or there might be something else going on there. Not sure we can trust her.\u201d\n\nKaroff spits out the end of his mustache. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get in there and find out the bitch slit their throats and made bikini tops out of their skin. Seen it happen before.\u201d\n\nYou look at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh, well not the skinning for bikinis part, but people get assigned to an out of the way place like this too long, they can just snap and start killing each other. Or there maybe was some kind of love triangle going on that turned nasty. And not the good kind of nasty,\u201d he adds, apparently feeling the need to clarify.\n\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re just going to have to risk our skins then,\u201d Hinsman says with a slight roll of his eyes. \u201cOr you and I anyway, Karoff. But Zee, you were always going to be working alone anyhow. You won\u2019t have us standing by in orbit if you go on by yourself, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from suiting up and taking a spare shuttle, if the job is urgent enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill may be awhile before we know exactly how bad the damage is to the Outpost,\u201d Karoff points out. \u201cShe could be needed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but...Zee, I guess this one is going to be your call. I don\u2019t have details on the mission you\u2019ve been requested for, so what\u2019s protocol here?\u201d\n\nThis would all be simpler if you could directly contact a commander, of course, but out here that\u2019s rarely possible and having to make decisions like this on the fly is part of the job.\n\nORDER when it started out stood for Outer Rim Defense, Evaluation and Research. The joke everyone likes to make is how when the Hunger virus appeared on the scene the E stood for Evacuation, and then finally Eradication.\n\nOf course that\u2019s the part you\u2019re all still working on. And it\u2019s not actually all that funny.\n\nThe Order is the peacekeeping force out past the edge of protected space, although not in any kind of official capacity anymore. A little over twenty years ago when the Hunger virus was at its peak and blazing from planet to planet, the border was rolled back and then rolled back again. Colonies and mining facilities, trading stations and outposts were cut off in the midst of the chaos and anyone who wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t evacuate was left to fend for themselves.\n\nSome of the Order agents were recalled back to New Terra, but for many more this was their home, this was just what they did. Momentum and habit went a long way and the organization already had enough ships, stations and equipment out here to continue operating much as they always had. If anything they were more effective now that the bureaucracy and red tape had been stripped away, although that sometimes birthed its own kind of controversy.\n\nIndependent, isolated colonies and small time miners and traders had no one to protect them from piracy, not to mention the trade consortiums that amounted to a more organized version of the same thing. They welcomed the Order\u2019s presence on one hand while resenting anything they perceived as meddling in their own affairs on another. In areas where the line between New Terra and frontier authorities blurred, certain parties also never failed to point out that the Order had no more jurisdiction than any other private organization; outside of the ancient one of might making right and the bit about possession and how it related to law, anyhow.\n\nAnd although on paper the organization kept to the same laws and standards they had from the beginning, they were just as on their own out here as anyone and had to see to their own people\u2019s interests and protection as well. New blood could be hard enough to find as it was without asking it to spill itself simply because it was the right thing to do. About the only thing anyone could agree on was that the Order were the only ones equipped to really do anything about the Hunger virus and so they should be left to it, no questions asked.\n\nSo thankfully, politics and the rest of that nonsense aren\u2019t anything you ever have to concern yourself with. All you do is your job, and all you worry about is doing it well. Right now that means making a judgment call on where you\u2019ll be the most effective. And right now, that does seem to be here. Nothing you were given indicated anyone was in direct danger, and the Last Outpost is as valuable to the Order as any of the other facilities you were asked to check on, and far more strategically important. The refueling station is what makes these little forays out in this area of Rim possible in the first place.\n", "Secure the station.": "You indicate to the others that you\u2019ll stay for now and Karoff directs the ship on a route toward the station. It makes sense to at least do a cursory inspection of the damage and make sure that at least life support will hold up. And of course there\u2019s the other issue of the alleged sabotage and personnel having been lost under circumstances still waiting to be confirmed. Leaving just two operatives to handle it all isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nOf the station\u2019s eight arms, the docking bay is luckily on the side that\u2019s suffered the least damage. Karoff locks on without incident and the panels of the reinforced portal retract with a gentle whirring. Beyond, the station is dark and cold. You all file out and make your way out of the landing bay and down a hallway with the aid of flashlights. With what little power remains rerouted to life support, the portal to the central complex refuse to open. Attempts to contact Oswen on a short range channel fail, and so Hinsman finally gets the door moving with the aid of his gun; wiring the energy cell to the panel next to it, that is. At the jolt of power it snaps open with sudden speed, then begins to close again in slow motion and grinds to a halt about a third of the way. The three of you squeeze past and before long find yourselves in an open area, a kind of joint dining hall and exercise room with dead video screens lining the walls.\n\nThe kitchen area behind the dining hall is a disaster zone of empty plastic trays, overflowing trash bins and spoiled food. There\u2019s no sign of Matti although you do find her abandoned ice cream bucket. The three of you begin to search area by area. Although reluctant to split up, you do move a bit faster than the others and take to checking into rooms and around corners ahead of them.\n\nA pool of vivid crimson against the polished grey tile is your first confirmation that something has gone wrong. You race forward to Matti Oswen\u2019s crumpled form and check her pulse, clamping another hand down on the stub of her severed arm. Lifting the woman from the ground and calling out to the others, you splash your way through the blood, tracking it behind you while more soaks into your uniform.\n\nA medical station was one of the places the three of you had already searched, so you hasten to it and deposit her on a steel table, keeping your grip just above the wound while Hinsman activates the computer.\n\n\u201cThis nursing AI was obsolete fifteen years ago,\u201d he grumbles, taking a protective suit from a persistently dinging open door and yanking it on over his clothes.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit of overkill?\u201d Karoff asks, watching him.\n\nHinsman\u2019s response is muffled through the breathing filter. \u201cIt won\u2019t let me even proceed without it. This place was last used to quarantine evacuees exposed to Hunger, there\u2019s no such thing as overkill as far as the computer is concerned. Just be glad the whole station isn\u2019t set to self destruct the moment someone gets a paper cut.\u201d He pauses a moment to apply a tourniquet. \u201cNow...Zee, you step back, it hates you too.\u201d\n\nKaroff looks at you and snorts. \u201cI imagine so. You look like you just left the scene of an axe murder.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d already moved away at Hinsman\u2019s order, and now you ruefully wipe you face, hoping to achieve a clean spot. Karoff\u2019s ensuing guffaw informs you you probably just made the situation worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go clean up the mess in the hall...and myself,\u201d you say, turning to go.\n\n\u201cZee, wait, wait, Miss Oswen is going to need an arm transplant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nYou blink at Karoff. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\nThis just provokes more laughter.\n\nHinsman, who has been preoccupied with the soothing voice of the medical AI and the use of instruments taken out of little drawers that have been popping open in sequence, now shakes his head at the two of you as he changes to clean gloves. \u201cI\u2019m not that good a doctor, I\u2019m afraid. Zee, you go on.\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers at Karoff and in the other hand produces an oversized needle, like a magician\u2019s trick. \u201cBut I will need a blood donor, and guess who\u2019s compatible?\u201d\n\nAlready on your way out, you turn and get a glimpse of the pilot\u2019s grimace as the door slides shut between you.\n\n\n\nCleaning up is a tedious but straightforward affair. You scrub yourself down and change into a plain grey jumpsuit you find before returning to the scene of the accident and getting to work.\n", "Dispose of the severed arm": "It seems Oswen had been trying to unjam a door that leads to one of the station\u2019s storage arms, in much the same way Hinsman had gotten you all into the central complex earlier. It was her misfortune that upon receiving a jolt from a maintenance tool the door had snapped shut, meaning it had been open to begin with.\n\nThere\u2019s enough juice left to get it back to where it was and you carefully retrieve the severed limb on the other side, slipping it into a biohazard bag. Taking a moment to confirm with Hinsman there\u2019s nothing he can do as far as reattaching it, you consider your options for disposal. An incinerator would the most straightforward, but those require an amount of energy that seems wasteful if not impossible to produce given the station\u2019s current reliance on emergency backup power for life support.\n\nYou remember then the walk in freezer in the kitchen behind the dining hall. At least that would keep it from rotting if it takes longer that expected to get the power on full. The room isn\u2019t able to maintain freezing temps anymore but it\u2019s still noticeably colder than the rest of the station, and the rest of the station is cold enough. Placing the bagged arm on a shelf, you halt a moment as your gaze fixes on the two bundled forms in the back. So you weren\u2019t the first one to have the idea to use the place as an impromptu morgue. These must be the bodies of the other two maintenance workers, Inea and Markov.\n", "Inspect the bodies": "Opening the largest body bag first, you briefly examine Markov. Evidence of cuts, burns, and some bits of broken glass still embedded in the skin seem consistent with him having been in the vicinity of an explosion, although there were a lot of unanswered questions in Matti\u2019s brief explanation. Further details will have to wait till she\u2019s conscious again, you suppose.\n\nYou zip the bag back up and turn your attention to Inea. The dark haired woman\u2019s cause of death is immediately obvious, her skull on the left side having been caved in just above and behind the ear. \u2018An accident while doing repairs\u2019 was how Matti had described her death. While you can\u2019t yet find anything to contradict that, as you probe along the edges of the splintered bits of skull and cold globs of brain matter it seems to you it would\u2019ve taken an awful lot of force concentrated in that one spot all at once to do that kind of damage.\n\nThen again, Matti had nearly managed to kill herself as well. You wonder what sort of accident it was supposed to have been. It\u2019s almost incredible to you that three people so incompetent had been left in charge of such an important Outpost. It\u2019s true that space is a big place and Order agents and personnel are stretched thin, but in your experience it\u2019s rare for things to go this spectacularly wrong without someone being at fault.\n\nFinding nothing more of note, you close up that body bag too and then exit the freezer. Grabbing a mop from the corner of the kitchen and filling up a bucket, you make your way back to where you\u2019d found Matti and go to work on the rapidly drying blood. The blood has begun to dry and it\u2019s obvious this will take awhile so you clear out your mind and focus on the task.\n", "Back to the nursing station": "Matti is asleep. Hinsman is seated at a table near the bed, freshly showered and changed into a grey jumpsuit identical to yours and looking exhausted. Karoff is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back on the ship seeing how much power we can spare,\u201d Hinsman tells you, before you can ask. \u201cThis medical station\u2019s about the only thing working as intended in this place right now. We need to at least get the computers up before we can figure out what all needs to be repaired and how. It\u2019d be really great if we had a maintenance worker familiar with the place to talk to, but...\u201d He inclines his head toward the young woman\u2019s supine form and shrugs. The end of what\u2019s left of her arm is neatly wrapped in bandages, but her face looks pale and strained even in her sleep and her eyes twitch restlessly behind her lids.\n\nBriefly you relate what you\u2019d discovered.\n\n\u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he mutters, then gestures toward the computer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you see what you can find there as far as internal records on these three?\u201d\n\nYou nod and take a seat, flashing your wrist at the sensor.

Your team is made up of three other people: Harry, John, and Luke. You all have undergone rigorous military training, including such training as firearms, survival tactics, and hand-to-hand combat. During one of your patrols, your team has found a derelict spaceship floating in an uncharted corner of space. You know this is outside your jurisdiction, but you decide to investigate anyway.\n\n\nYou and your team board the ship wearing space suits, since the life support systems are down. The ship seems to have been here a long time. There is dirt and grime on the dark blue walls. There are numerous geometric shapes jutting out of the walls. This is architecture that you have never seen before. Your team finds a square, grey door and opens it manually using Harry and John's physical strength. Inside there is a console full of buttons and switches. One switch has a sign that you recognize as the international symbol for \"Life Support\". You flick it on and air is pumped into the ship. \n\n\nYour team hesitantly takes off their helmets. You all find that you can breathe normally. Everyone then abandons their space suits and packs them into their backpacks. You continue to explore the ship and find yourself in a large, circular room that is pitch black.\n\n\nSuddenly the lights come on by themselves. You turn around to see if anyone in the team has flicked a switch or pressed a button, but they're all directly behind and beside you. They're not close to any kind of control panel.\n\n\nA cold, synthetic voice then comes on the speakers.\n\n\n\"Foolish humans,\" it says. \"Do you think you could trespass in my domain with no repercussions? I am the great AMZAK! Bow before my superior intellect! Your race is inferior. Prepare to be assimilated, just like the old crew on this ship!\"\n\n\nYou notice many doors on the walls of the room. They all open at once to a large swarm of cyborgs. This must be the old crew AMZAK was talking about. They are almost completely machine. The only thing left of them that is human is the right side of their faces. The other side is covered in a metal mask with wires and tubes running out of it to different parts of their bodies. Their left eyes are covered by red, translucent circles that each emit a thin red beam of light from the center. On their backs they each have a tube with an accordion. The accordion spreads and contracts at a consistent rhythm with their breathing. The rest of their bodies are a mesh of grey metal plating, wires and tubes. Their left arms are covered in wires, whereas their right arms each have a large sharp knife on the end.\n\n\nThey slowly move towards your crew. You all take out your pistols and point them at the cyborgs.\n\n\n\"Stop right there or we'll shoot,\" you yell out, a small tremor in your voice.\n\n\nThe cyborgs ignore your warning and keep walking towards you. You all begin firing. You shoot at their heads and bodies, blood spraying out from both. They're still human underneath, so they go down with one or two shots, but there's just too many of them. They start to close in on your team. You all move closer together as the army of cyborgs surrounds you.\n\n\n\"There's no way we can fight this many enemies,\" you tell your team. \"We'll have to retreat!\"\n\n\n\"But how?\" asks Luke, obviously terrified. \"They've got us surrounded.\"\n\n\n\"Shoot down as many as you can and clear a path,\" you reply. \"That's the only way.\"\n\n\nEach person in your team then goes on to do that, but in the ensuing chaos, you all take different doorways and end up split up from each other. \n", "Continue": "You find yourself in a room with a large green holographic map displayed in front of you.

In this story, you will be playing a rookie 27-year old Alien Hunter named Frederick Cobblestone who believes that there exists a race of aliens in the universe. Unfortunately, nobody believes him, not even his closest friends. But even if the public may disagree, Frederick continued his alien work well... alienated from society. But his undying passion for this sci-fi work only got him so far as his life started to tumble down with no job and his research at a standstill. Poor guy. He just wanted to find out more of our universe, and yet there was no one there to support his actions. As for you, player, maybe you can turn this mid-20 year old millennial into a happier person, with the right decisions, of course. Are you ready?\n", "The Story Begins!": "You wake up on your beat-up light brown chair after a night of intense research over an occurrence that appeared in Japan back in 2004. It was about some mysterious train station that isolated victims and supposedly kidnap them, never to be seen again. However, the more you explored this investigation, the more you couldn't find anything new from what was left on the internet. Either way, you feel exhausted as you stretch your arms. Surrounding you is your claustrophobic office closet, covered top and bottom with pieces of scribbled-on scrap paper that only you can understand. These papers has various symbols and wording written on them, too much really to describe to you, the player in vast detail. In front of you is a small wooden desk with an old faded white-colored computer monitor on top from the 90's. The material of this computer has grew with age, gaining dust as the years went buy despite your constant use of the hardware. If you had the money, you could buy a brand new monitor, but you persist with your poor circumstances. Even though you could be going outside, you decide to get more research in on that station while you are awake.\n\n\nHowever, unexpected of you, a horrible static noise bursts from your low-grade computer speakers. The loud banshee-like scream of the computer forces you to cover your ears. The audio becomes increasingly louder as the sound waves it creates shatters the nearby windows of your home and interrupts the traffic of your neighborhood. As the noise continues, you open your eyes a bit to see your computer screen start to glitch in a variety of disfigured images that you yourself don't recognize. You don't how much longer the noise will last, but after a good 30 seconds, the noise ceases. Relieved, you uncover your ears. All you can hear now is the distant sounds of barking dogs and car horns.\n\n\nAs you get up from your seat to inspect your computer, the monitor continues to glitch out in a variety of vivid and distorted images of mysterious photographs. From the mess of these flashing pictures, you can only make out a farm field, a picture of the Earth, a blurry shuttle, and most mysteriously, a picture of a large circle cut into a corn field. The circle itself is shaped in a plethora of odd patterns that even you can't make sense of. But after some of the glitches make their debut, the screen cuts to a longitude and latitude location, numbered as \"40.6331\u00b0 N, 89.3985\u00b0 W\" in a dark green digitized font. You quickly grab your nearby by iPhone and snap a picture of the location text before the monitor shuts down in an error message. After a quick google search, you recognize that the location code leads to the state of Illinois. Even more, your hometown is a state across in Missouri, making an easy trip to the state. You think to yourself as to why the monitor would even glitch like that.

Afterall, what kind of human could produce such an other-worldly event like the one you just experienced. It just seems too eleborate to be a prank as well. As such, you decide to investigate more into this mystery. With your rejuvenated spirit regained, you pick up your nearby phone once again to research any mysterious happenings in Illinois. With slow internet speed, you manage to find a video on YouTube from a local news channel just posted a few days ago. The video displays a variety of wide shot pictures of a farmer's cornfield, showing several mysterious circles carved into the ground. One the circles you recognize appears to be the same one that was found on your computer when it was flashing. Even more apparent, the circle you happened to recognize is the largest of the field, twice the size of the other circles. You start to listen to the video as a newscaster and a farmer appear on screen with the captions \"Mysterious Circles Found Cut Into Local Farmer's Cornfield\" displayed at the bottom.\n\n\n\"Good morning Missouri, I am Sarah Gale. Today we are here at the Gary White Family Farm in Illinois to interview the local owner of the farm, Charlie White,\" says the Newscaster.\n\n\n\"Thank you Mrs. Gale for bringing me on h...\" responds Charlie. \"So Mr. White, we are here to discuss these mysterious circles carved into the ground. Do you know when this started and how it has been affecting you?\" interrupts Sara.\n\n\n\"Well Mrs. Gale, this whole circular mystery thing going on here had started a couple of weeks ago. At first it was just a single circle in the ground but day after day, more circles started to appear on my cornfields. So many were appearing that the police station had to keep searching every night to find out where they were coming from. They even had to limit how many guests come by to purchase the crops we grow. It's even more difficult when those crops across the field just disappear or become rotten. And I'll tell ya, I've been running my brother's farm for a long time but I had never seen such a depletion of my crops and customers since the 2008 recession. I barely got enough money to pay for my family's food outside of our own crops. And when I find that damn troublemaker, I'm gonna m...\"\n\n\n\"Oooo K, well thank you for your time Mr. White. Well, you heard it here folks, it seems whatever is affecting this farm could be anything, perhaps an alien encounter? Well who knows. But before we move on to our next story of the morning, Mr. White has provided his phone number on screen in case anyone at all wanted to help him. Now back to you Frank.\" finishes Sarah.\n\n\nOnce the Newscaster finishes, a phone number appears on the phone screen.\n\n\nYou decide to call the number on the video, figuring that you will be allowed to search around for alien life and learn more about what exactly is happening, plus the advantage of a possible award for your hard work if you find anything.\n\n\nYou type in the number on your phone and prepare to call the farmer. After a few seconds. the caller picks up.\n\n\n\"Hello, who is this?\" says Mr. White\n\n\n\"Hi, are you Mr. White from the Missouri News?\" you say to the farmer.\n\n\n\"Yes. Are you another one of those hooligans who is just here to prank call me just because of my 'alien encounter' situation?\"\n\n\n\"What, no, I'm just calling because it seemed you needed help looking for an explanation for your crop circle mess.\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm, well... how do I know your not just messing with me?\"\n\n\n\"Well for starters, I have for over 15 years studied all sorts of mysterious happenings across the world, and I truly believe your situation could be related to a possible encounter from another other-worldly being.\"\n\n\n\"Do you have proof?\" questions Mr. white\n\n\n\"Uh, well, not exactly, b-but I do have some experience and given your circumstances, it seems you really need some support\" you say back.\n\n\nThe farmer waits to respond as you hear him ponder with himself over the phone. With a deep sigh, the farmer reluctantly says, \"Well... me and my family are very desperate for some sort of sense, and the police haven't been much help for us. 'sigh' Ok, I'll let you come by tonight to find out more about this mystery. And just in case, I'll pay you for finding anything at all, just as long as you show up and whatever you find is worth something. We'll say around $500 at max.\"\n\n\n\"Ok, I'll be right over there ASAP\" you respond as you hang up. It seems now you finally have the chance to discover some sort of alien life. You step out of your closet office and head outside to your beat-up white van, packed with several bits of equipment and materials for hunting aliens that you designed yourself. This arsenal includes a laser blaster (a special laser-shooting blaster that can charge up to shoot energy blasts. Usually has a low amount of energy, so use lightly), a camera (a special camera used to snap photos that never blur or smudge), a scanner (a modified iPad that can scan the environment for foreign materials and substances), and a smoke spreader (a bomb-like weapon that spews out smoke upon detection with an object; used to distract enemies with only one spreader). With these weapons in your arsenal you head out to the farm in Illinois to learn more about these mysterious circles.\n", "Entering the Fields": "You arrive in your van to the 'Gary White Family Farm' in Illinois. The area, now shaded under a evening sky, is filled with a plethora of blue shaded hills, several large cornfields abound, and a small wooden barnhouse in the center. Stepping out of your van, you can smell the country air of freshly-cut grass and feel the crunch of the dirt road beneath your feet. Over the horizon, you see the crop circles carved into the cornfields, all showing different circular patterns around. As you walk towards the barn, the front door swings open to reveal Mr. Charlie White from the video. He approaches you in a pair of navy blue jeans, a simple white t-shirt covered in dirt, and a pair of black and brown boots.\n\n\n\"Well look who it is!\" says Mr. White, \"I thought you never arrive.\"\n\n\n\"Good thing I did\" you say back. \"Well, I guess it's time for you to get started with this investigation thing right?\"\n\n\n\"Uh, yes, but before we begin, do you know anymore information about these mysterious circles that happen to appear on your farm?\"\n\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure if I know anymore information after talking on the news. But, I do recall hearing these 'wrrrr' noises when I'm sleeping at night. Though each time I check to see outside, I don't see anything and the noise just stops.\"\n\n\n\"That's odd. I don't think I've heard of that 'noise' before.\"\n\n\nCome to think of it, usually these 'wrrr' noises may only appear in movie and TV shows that reference aliens. But it seems that the noise may be a real thing outside of the mass media.\n\n\nYou say back to Mr. White \"Well Mr. White, whatever cosmic infestation is disrupting your farm, I'll dispose of it as efficient as possible.\" Mr. White now looks more relieved after hearing this news and starts to smile with a wide grin.\n\n\nMr. White says, \"Ok, I hope I can trust you on that offer. As for now, I'm going to head to bed to get some shut-eye.\"\n\n\nConfused, you ask, \"Don't you want to stay up to see what it could possibly be?\"\n\n\n\"I would, but I think it's best for my mental health to fall asleep. I am utterly tired after countless awake nights just trying to fall asleep because of that 'wrrr' noise. 'Yawn' Good night, see you in the morning.\"\n\n\nMr. White heads back inside his barn as he shuts the door, leaving you alone in the night-bearing area. You need to devise a strategy in order to figure out who or what has been causing these circles to appear and cause this 'wrrr' noise. You could wait in your car in safety to wait for anything to appear, or you could immediately check out the largest circle in the fields to get a closer inspection.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Extra Info: Crop Circles": "                                                                            \n\nNote: This is not a major page but just an information page to inform people about these real mysteries.\n\n\nTo give more insight, crop circles are mysterious circular patterns that appear on the fields of farmers overnight. One of the first popular cases of these crop circles was reported back in 1966 when a farmer in Tully, Australia had saw a sort of flying saucer in the sky fly away, leaving a circle of debris of flattened reeds and grass. Since then, the popularity and attention of crop circles have further been pushed in the Pop Culture of humans creating many movies, TV shows, books, and even a group of researchers called \"Cereologists\" inspired by the circles. However, while these vague circles are extremely popular, even today, the whole backbone of the mystery is at a less than desirable standstill. Some theorize that crop circles are created by time traveling humans who contact information to lead the planet, and others believe they are physically created by aliens from space. But without any solid evidence, many people just believe that these circles are just a hoax. And while a few cases have appeared saying that some crop circles were created by pranking humans, there are still some genuine crop circles too large or complex to even be made by hoaxers.\n", "Check Out Circles In Fields": "You decide to check out those circles in the fields. With your interest in the mystery peaking, it would be a waste of a decision to just simply wait it out. It could, rather, be more useful to explore these circles up close and personal. And so, you garb your arsenal of equipment out of your car and head straight for the fields.\n\n\nAs you walk to what appears to be the largest of circles, you hear the distant sounds of crickets and the rustle of the crops. Once you make it to the the largest circle, you pull out your scanner to check the contents of the circles. The scanner was made out of an old iPad tablet and an Infrared Scanner mangled together via wires and electricity to create an amalgamated mess of a device used to detect substances that may be foreign to normal based substances in a given area like a piece of broken-off steel of a plane in the middle of the ocean. The scanner well... scans the circle with a wide red beam spewing out from light at the back of the device. Once the scan has finished, an image appears on your device to give a better look at the circle. The image shows a large circular shape etched into the fields. The shapes insides contain several patterns of circular motifs that don't look human on sight. But most surprisingly is the color of this circle. Compared to the rest of the field, which is showcased in blue, red, and green colors to represent the plants and dirt, the circle is depicted all around with a light violet color that almost seems to glitch out on viewing. This circle seems to be foreign based on its own color scheme. You ponder to yourself for a minute thinking that this violet color depicted on the scanner means that something otherworldly carved this circle into the ground. But while you consider this theory, a type of \"wrrr\" noise springs in your ear. Surprised, your attention is immediately on where the noise has came from until you look up to find something otherworldly: a large circular ship is floating down from the sky. Your jaw drops to the ground as the ship stop midair. While you can't see much of the ship, you notice that the ship starts to shoot a thin light violet laser on the fields and starts to carve something into the fields. However, you no time to react as you take cover by jumping into the fields to avoid the sight of the laser. While your research is important, whatever this ship is doing may or may not harm the farm further given that the fields are already filled with these types of circles, ones that have been negatively affecting the lives of Mr. White's family and their farm. You ponder whether to shoot down the ship or wait in the fields to see what may pop up upon the spacecraft's completion of their laser procedure.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Shoot Down The Spacecraft (BAD END)": "You decide that you should shoot down the ship. After all, the ship is causing massive damage to the area and if you simply let the ship go, there will be no benefits for you or the farmer's family. And even if you wanted the research the ship, you can still pick up evidence even if the ship is down.\n\n\nAs such, you grab your laser blaster and aim it directly at the ship. While you have a limited amount of energy shown in the tank, you fire anyway with one clean shot to the bottom of the ship. Unfortunately, the ship, from what you can see, has refracted the laser bullet to smack the ground below. As you stand there astounded by what just occurred, the ship pulls back the laser and turns to face you with that same laser turret. It activates the laser and fires directly into your head, killing you on the spot as you fall to the ground with a burned hole carved into your forehead. This is where your story ends.\n", "Wait In Fields": "You decide to wait in the fields. As much as your willing to directly stop the ship from harming the fields, taking matters into your own hands may be too much of a risk to consider on the possible thought that the ship may not go down upon your laser firing. As such, you stay hidden in fields until the ship is finished with its cutting of the fields. Though, while you're waiting, you decide to observe the ship for the next few minutes while you wait. You sit down in the fields and grab your iPhone to type down notes about the ship. From what you have observed, the ship is a large circular, saucer-plate shaped spacecraft covered in dark-violet and blue colors. The ship appears to have a glass dome that you can see through. On closer inspection, you can see black silhouetted figures walking across the top of the ship. As your the size of the ship, it scales on twice the length and height of the nearby farmhouse.\n\n\nOnce the ship finishes its pattern-making process, the ship retracts its beam and floats slowly to the ground. In doing so, the ship opens up a platform that slides out from the bottom of the ship and lands directly onto the ground. You hurry to sneak farther away from the ship to stay away from any possible danger. As you look at the platform, you can see a figure dressed in black hooded robe stepping onto the field holding a strange purple substance in its arms. This could be the perfect chance to shoot down the alien to prevent further harm, but it could also be a risk not worth taking. But even more, you can also take the platform into the ship and find the source and leader of the ship on board.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Continue Waiting": "You decide to continue waiting in the fields. While it's a perfect opportunity to shoot down the alien to prevent further harm, you still don't know the full scale of what exactly is happening with these aliens and simply shooting one down may not make much of a difference and put you in an even more riskier situation.\n\n\nAs you wait in the fields, you see the figure place down the purple substance on the ground. The figure leaves the spot and takes the exposed platform back up to the ship. The ship flies into the sky and leaves the fields, never being noticed by anyone except you. With this, you walk over to the substance and examine exactly what it is. The substance seems to move almost like a gelatinous food item and simply wiggles and swashes on the ground. You quickly run back to your van to grab a jar, a pair of gloves, and a large spoon to sample the substance. You quickly make it back to discover that the substance is slowly be absorbed by the ground getting smaller and smaller by the second. With no time to waste, you scoop the remainder of the substance with your spoon and contain it inside the jar. Thankfully, the jar doesn't break and conceals the substance completely unharmed. Satisfied with the collection of the substance, you head back to the van to get some rest until the next day.\n", "The Next Day (NORMAL END)": "On the next day, you show the farmer what you had collected to show that some otherworldly force is causing this substance to be absorbed into the dirt. The farmer, impressed with your knowledge and research promises you to pay only 3/4 of the price he was willing to pay you out of concern over the fact the problem of the crop circles wasn't solved completely. However, he says that the substance could be yours if you wanted to take it. \n\n\nAs much as you would want to keep the substance for yourself, it may be best to give the substance to the farmer to help him out with the authorities and public reception. After all, it was his problem in first place that he even called you down here anyway, so it would be mean to not give him the substance. As such, you tell the farmer to keep the substance for himself and that he deserves it more than you. The farmer waves you good bye as you walk to your van and drive off in the brightness of the morning with a nice blue sky and a patch of white clouds. \n\n\nFor the next few weeks, you start to use the money to repair your broken windows after the noise incident occurred with your monitor, pay your much needed bills, and upgrade your house's hardware and technology. One day though as you relax on your living room couch and watch the news after a long day, you see Mr. White being interviewed by a couple of newscasters. He discusses that he had created a special substance called \"Alien Goop\" that is able to morph and shape into a variety of unique structures, the same one you had found on his farm. He claims the substance is able to shine up products, create a protective material to prevent attacks from bullets to knives and can capture objects easily in its grasp. You seem to be amazed that this substance, while be used as a marketing item, is able to do so much. But before the interview is over, Mr. White mentions that you, Frederick Cobblestone, were a major part of the research and that you were the true discoverer of this substance. As the interview turns off, you feel excited that your research, albeit turned into a money-milking device, has finally given you the attention you deserve. As of today, you are now a major part of the income being sent to you and are now seen as a major part of a massive research crew on the use of \"Alien Goop\" and where the existence of aliens may occur at.\n", "Shoot Alien": "You decide to shoot down the alien. You consider that by shooting down the alien, you could prevent whatever it's doing and help out the area in general in case the substance were to be hazardous.\n\n\nWith confidence, you grab your laser blaster, with its limited energy, and fire directly at the head of the figure. The laser blasts the figure in the head as it stumbles about. weakened by the attack. After a few seconds of the figure wobbling around, they fall to the ground with the violet substance in their arms. Then you start to point the blaster directly at the spacecraft as a threat that you will also shoot it down if necessary. In doing this, the spacecraft flies off into space to escape your blast as you stand there triumphant that you were able to get rid of those aliens from harming the fields. But your victory is cut short once you hear a growing noise come from behind you. You turn around to see the figure alive as it become encassed in the violet substance. The figure twitches aggressively until it puts its hands on the ground. The figure morphs and shapes more and more, growing larger and larger as the violet substance continues to encompass the figure until it becomes a wild violet and black creaure that you can't even recognize with piercing yellow eyes, a set of sharp monstrous teeth, and a pair of large claws. The creature turns to face you, ready to strike. You have to be quick on your feet to avoid the creature thoroughly.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Immediately Shoot (BAD END)": "You decide to shoot the monster directly in the head just as you did before. You figure that if you shoot the head of this monster it will go down easier just as much as it did earlier.\n\n\nWith your efforts, you grab your laser blaster to fire another shot, one that has been charged up to the max. However, while the blast functioned correctly even with a limited supply of energy, the blast dissipates on the monster's face with barely any knockback. The monster, furious with your attempted murder, lunges directly at you and pierces through your skin, cutting you into two. The monster leaves your body on the ground as it runs off to cause more havoc upon the world. This is where your story ends.\n", "Use The Platform To Enter The Ship": "You decide to enter the platform to get onto the ship. By getting on, you could discover more about these figures and possibly find out what mysteries they hide that you cannot see.\n\n\nYou quickly sneak onto the exposed platform as the figure starts to place down the substance on the ground. On the platform, there lies a risen panel with a set of buttons. While the two largest buttons are colored in green and purple, the symbols on these buttons appear unrecognizable.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Press The Green Button (BAD END)": "You decide to press the green button. The green button could mean that the platform rises back up into the ship. Even more, the symbol on the button happens to look like an arrow point up, albeit with a more curvy design.\n\n\nYou press the button and expect to be risen up into the ship via the platform. Instead, the entrance closes up and the platform starts to glow a errie green light. Above you, you notice a blaster turret forming from the bottom of the spacecraft as it charges up what appears to be a laser blast. You try to run away and get off the platform, but whatever the blast is doing creates a barrier around the platform as the blaster fires at the surface of the platform. Your body, emcompassed by the blast, starts to burn at a 1000 degrees as the blast damages your body. yHowever, your body starts to melt rather than turn to ash. your skin becomes purple-ish, your bones and organs turn to what feels like jello, and you sight becomes hazier and hazier. Soon enough, you turn into the purple substance you just saw earlier in which you are picked-up by the figure and sent into the ship in which you live in a containment cell filled with water, never to be seen again by the world. This is where your story ends.\n", "Wait In Your Car": "You decided to wait in your car. While your interest into this mystery is peaking, you consider the fact that you might need some sleep before you can begin your investigation after that long car ride. This is also not to mention that if you happened to be unprepared if an alien were to show up, you have the advantage of staying in your car in safety. You walk over to your car and sit down on your seat to take a quick nap before the investigation. You close your eyes to sounds of crickets and the smells of the country, falling unconscious in the peace that surrounds you in the countryside. Well it would be if you didn't hear a more stranger sound. 30 seconds after you close your eyes, you wake up to the sound of a \"wrrr\" noise outside your car. Realizing the sound was similar to the description by the farmer, you look outside your car window to see an even stranger sight: a large circular spacecraft floating over the fields in the sky. The ship, covered in dark-violet and blue colors, is shaped like a saucer dish with a chrome dome on top. The ship beams a light blue laser on the fields, which from the distance makes it look like it's scanning the area. You duck down for cover as the ship continues to scan the environment. However, next to you is your camera, one device that is able to take a photo. You can go outside to get a clearer picture or stay in your car to take that photo.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Don't Investigate Into It": "                                                                                 \n\nYou decide to not investigate into this mystery. You figure that this was a massive computer glitch that just happened to appear on your monitor. It could be because the previous night of intense research was taking a toll on your computer or it could simply be your old hardware malfunctioning. Either way, you get up to inspect the damage on your windows and hardware to see if anything else happened to break.\n\n\nFor the next couple hours, you do your daily morning routine of making breakfast, watch the local news on television, and continuing your research in your office closet. You decide that it is best for you to go out and buy some news windows. Before walking out the door, you start to hear a knock with the sounds of police sirens in the air. Now at the front door, which doesn't have a window on it, you open it up to reveal two police officers in front of you. The officers are wearing black and blue uniforms and a police hat on their heads whilst holding a pistol on the side of their pockets and a pair of handcuffs.\n\n\nThe first officer says to you \"Hello sir, are you the owner of this home, Frederick Cobblestone?\"\n\n\nYou respond back,\"Uh, yes, yes I am officer.\"\n\n\nThe other police officer starts talking into his nearby walky-talky in police code, notifying someone on the other line. The first police officer continues,\"Mr. Cobblestone, we are here to question you about the glass shattering event that occured just a few hours ago. Many of the people in this neighborhood have informed that several of their appliances have shattered into pieces from this noise-oriented blast, which from rumors appears to draw all the way back to your home. Do you care to explain what exactly happened?\"\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Lie To Police": "You decide to lie to the police. You figure that they aren't going to listen to what actually happened. You respond back to them that the audio noise that destroyed those appliances wouldn't be traced back your home as it was so loud that you couldn't even hear it coming from your own home. The police officers ponder for a few seconds.\n\n\nThe police officers respond back to you,\"Sir, while it may seem you're innocent we will be back later today with more information on whether your statement was true or not. However, as of now, enjoy the rest of your day!\"\n\n\nThe police officers leave in their nearby police car and drive off. Relieved, you head back in your home to relax after such an incident.\n\n\nAs the day went on, you kept wondering what actually happened to your computer to cause such a glitch to occur. You figure that you could say that it was caused by aliens, but even now, you have gone so far into the rabbit hole of alien life that you can't even make anymore sense of what could actually be the cause of alien forces. But, through your own pondering, you persist on your daily schedule at home until the early evening. By 5:30, the time you would be making your own dinner from frozen supermarket packages, you start hearing the sounds of angry people outside of your door. You peak out from your door window, which has not broken yet from the noise earlier, and see dozens of people from the neighborhood yelling out at you to get out of the home.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Stay Inside": "You decide to stay inside your home. You figure that the crowd, although only vocally mean, may be harmful to you, opting more for violence rather than reasoning. For the next minute, things seem to go alright, that is until a brick smashes through your window door, exposing the crowd outside to you. A couple of people try to open up the door and some trying to crawl through the window in the door. Thankfully, there were no windows in your kitchen or living room, otherwise the mob would be able to break in easily. But there's no more time to think as you hurry upstairs to safety as you lock your bedroom door. Soon enough, you start hear the mob smashing on your bedroom door trying to open it up. The only option you have left is to get out of the nearby bedroom window (which has shattered from earlier). Before you leave, you have 2 items that you may want to grab before departing: Your computer or your iPhone.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Take the Computer (BAD END)": "You decide to take the computer. It may be worn out and still a bit glitchy, but it may serve you well in case you need to survive. You quickly head to your closet to grab your computer. Unfortunately, the outlet the computer is connected to has become stuck. With all your might, you try to pull the plug as hard as you can. You keep pulling as sweat drips down your face and as the bedroom door starts to breakdown piece by piece. It's a struggle, but you start feel the plug disconnecting from the outlet. You start to smile, relieved that the computer is finally unstuck. That is until you notice that the plug was actually breaking from you pulling so hard. The plug snaps in two and electrocutes you on the spot. The electricity pushes into your veins and shocks you to death as you fall to the ground. This is were your story ends.\n", "Tell the Truth (BAD END)": " \n\n\n\nYou figure that if you tell the truth to the Police, they will start to understand your circumstances and help you investigate more into this mysterious occurrence. You explain to the officers that this noise came from your computer but was never an intentional attack on the entire neighborhood. Rather, your computer was corrupted by some mysterious glitch that you had no control over and the noise it made was unnatural. The police officers look at each other, confused by your statements. \n\n\nAs the other police officer talks more lingo into his walky-talky, the first police officer says to you, \"Sir, do you mind stepping around for a second?\"\n\n\nYou respond back, \"Oh sure.\" As you turn around, you hear the sound of chains as your wrists become wrapped around and locked in a pair of handcuffs.\n\n\nThe first police officer tells you, \"Sir, you are being under arrest for the massive damage of public property across the neighborhood.\"\n\n\nYou are forced inside the nearby police car and are driven off directly to the local prison just a few miles away from your home. You now live in a dirty, gray-colored jail cell for the next few years.

Its serpentine eyes stare at you evilly. You think it's one the ugliest things you've ever seen.      \n\n    \"Well,\" says Margaret Sullivan, \"What do you think?\"      \n\n    You hand the sketchpad back to her. \"I don't know...is he supposed to be the Devil or something?\"      \n\n    \"The Devil? Why's it have to be the Devil? It's obviously something from my subconscious, but I think calling it the Devil is a little on the nose. I woke up from my dream at 4:15 this morning and immediately had to draw the creature while I could still recall it. I'm planning on adding this to my visual dream journal. If I get enough images together, maybe I can publish it as a book.\" She places her sketchpad back in the satchel by her chair.      \n\n    You take a swig of your chocolate milk. \"You're talented, though, Margaret. I'm especially impressed with your use of cross-hatching. I'm such a poor artist in comparison to you. I think art's my weakest subject.\"      \n\n    \"But not planetary geography. Looks like I'll have no choice but to spend some more scholastic time with you.\" Margaret smiles at you coyly and brushes a lock of auburn hair from her green eye. \u201cWell, Miss Acosta, you still willing to help me study for my geography test?\u201d She sits back in her chair at the table and crosses one leg over the other, letting her knee peek out from under the blue skirt of her uniform.\n\n     All you can think is that her stocking is sagging down her calf.          \n\n    \u201cStop that,\u201d you say, looking around the cafeteria in embarrassment.  \n\n    The other girls are busy in their clusters talking to each other (mostly of things unrelated to schoolwork or the glory of God) and don\u2019t seem to notice or care.  Most of the nuns and Father Michael are at their table, bordly picking at their lunches. \n\n    You nervously take a sip from your milk carton and say, \u201cI can help you\u2026that is if we can stay on task this time.\u201d          \n\n    Margaret frowns. \u201cDo you not like this, Sandra? I thought\u201d-- she looks down and inhales-- \u201cyou liked me.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOh, oh I do!\u201d You stare at the roast beef on you plate. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026maybe Ursuline Academy isn't the best place for us to get to know each other better. I mean, yes, I will help you with geography. My dad\u2019s taken me all over Venus on his business trips, so I do know a thing or two about the layout of the two continents and the islands\u2026\u201d         \n\n    Margaret\u2019s milky hand clasps your light-brown fingers tightly. \u201cAre you uncomfortable with this?\u201d          \n\n    You shake your head. \u201cNo\u2026But what if we get caught? You don\u2019t know what my parents are like, especially my father. Your parents have to be more progressive than mine.\u201d          \n\n    Margaret clasps her other hand to yours and pulls it to her lips. Your eyes dart about the cafeteria. Father Michael has risen from his table with his tray. He\u2019s heading to your side of the cafeteria.          \n\n    \n\n   \u201cYoung Lady!\u201d shouts Esmeralda\u2019s metallic voice.          \n\n    You jerk out of your reverie and return to the present. The tall trees of the family garden block most of the Vernerian sky in a wall of green foliage. Your robot tutor stands before you, one steel-gray claw pointing at you disapprovingly. Her glowing red eyes seem to have darkened to the hue of blood.          \n\n    \u201cI asked you what you thought of Thoreau\u2019s argument that civilized people spend too much time worrying about the baser aspects of the human society. Well? What is your opinion?\u201d          \n\n    You look at her with her flat face, her four spindly legs and two clawed hands and keep thinking she looks like a cross between a dress-maker\u2019s dummy and a praying mantis. It\u2019s sometimes so easy to laugh at such an absurd machine, even though you've known her for years.         \n\n     \u201cWell\u2026?\u201d she asks in her most pompous tone of voice.          \n\n    You sigh and drum your fingers on the white arm of your wicker chair. \u201cI think Henry David Thoreau was a spoiled rich idiot who had too much free time on his hands.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cReally! Is that what you think?\u201d          \n\n    \u201cIsn't that usually what the rich do?\u201d You ask. \u201cIf they\u2019re unsatisfied with their careers they go running off to \u2019find themselves\u2019. He just happened upon Walden Pond and decided to go roughing it like any pretentious fool.\u201d          \n\n    Esmeralda walks to the birdbath where several leathery-winged creatures splash in the water. She then pulls her head up fast enough for you to hear the servo motor in her neck.              \n\n    She\u2019s not saying anything, you think. You\u2019d better come up with something to back up your argument. \u201cWhat I mean is that he can complain about how newspapers print stories of similar crimes time after time, but people who actually try to go about living their lives (holding down jobs and such) care if there was a murder a few blocks away from where they live. It\u2019s not--\u201d          \n\n    \u201cHush!\u201d she says in a low voice.          \n\n    \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You rise from your chair and walk up to the robot by the birdbath.          \n\n    Esmeralda is still staring up at the sky. \u201cI hear something.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t hear anything other than frog-bats calling from the trees.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOf course not, my dear. You\u2019re only human. But I hear something. A rocket ship. It\u2019s landing not far from here.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOn the island?\u201d          \n\n    \u201cYes. There are no scheduled visits for today. This seems most irregular.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s probably just a surprise visit from one of my dad\u2019s associates at the mining company. That happens sometimes. Besides, this is restricted airspace for most ships. They'd have to have some kind of security clearance or get shot out of the sky by the orbital station.\u201d          \n\n    Esmeralda pulls her head down to face you. \u201cIt\u2019s landed.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cWell, that\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s like I said--\u201d          \n\n    She puts a steel claw to your lips for silence. \u201cI can hear them disembarking from the ship. There are four of them.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cHow far are they from the house?\u201d          \n\n    Esmeralda removes her claw from your lips. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cA walk? Where?\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOut of the garden. Into the jungle.\u201d          \n\n    You put your hands up in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d          \n\n    \u201cSandra, do you trust me?\u201d          \n\n    \u201cOf course. More than my own parents.\u201d          \n\n    \u201cThen follow me.\u201d  She scuttles away on her four legs like a spider and you reluctantly follow her.\n", "In the House": "You follow Esmeralda as she picks her way through the tall trees along a barely-discernible path. You look up at the towering trees, festooned with snaking vines, their tops disappearing into the white mists of the planet\u2019s lower cloud barrier. You\u2019ve no idea what is going on, or why your robot tutor seems to think she does, but she knows things about your parents (particularly your father) that you don\u2019t. Impatient and nervous, you can no longer remain quiet.\n\n    \u201cEsmeralda, what\u2019s going on? Why are we running away from the house? Are my parents in danger?\u201d\n\n    Still scuttling along the jungle path, the robot rotates her head 180 degrees to regard you with her glowing red eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if your parents are in danger, Sandra. But if they are, I don\u2019t want you to be as well. Please continue to follow me. We must wait this out. Once the men are gone, we may return to the house.\u201d Her head swivels back to face the upcoming path through the trees.         \n\n    No, you don\u2019t particularly like your parents. You especially don\u2019t like your father. But you don\u2019t want them to come to harm, either. Without saying a word, you stop walking, turn around, and head back to the house.\n\n    \u201cYoung lady!\u201d\n\n    \u201cNo, Esmeralda. I won\u2019t listen to you anymore.\u201d You press on with ever-increasing steps. Soon you\u2019re running through the trees. You hear Esmeralda\u2019s servos as she chases after you, but you ignore the robot as you push your way into the garden. It\u2019s not long before you\u2019ve crossed the flagstones and have nothing but a green sward of lawn between you and the white Victorian mansion.\n\n    You run onto the flagstoned path leading to the front of the house, bound up the stone steps two at a time, then through the arched doorway through one of the frosted-glass double doors-- which is strangely ajar.  The living room stands before you with its polished blue marble tiles and the two spiral staircases that fold out of the opposite wall like the wings of a dove. Dashing across the tiles (the clacking of your heals possibly alerting any intruders, you realize), you grab the copper banister with the statue of Hephaestus and hurl yourself up one of the staircases, again running two-at-time up the plum-carpeted steps. You hear no sounds other than your muffled footfalls.\n\n    Was this a bad idea? What if it\u2019s too late, anyway? Then you\u2019ve just put yourself in danger too. No, you shouldn't worry about that. Your parents are your main concern right now.\n\n    You rush down the hall, past open doorways until you get to the dark oak-wood door at the end. Framed by an ornately carved filigree of vines is another Hephaestus, standing before you in godly splendor, holding a blacksmith\u2019s hammer in one hand and regarding you with his great cyclopean eye. The master bedroom. Should you knock? No time for formalities.\n\n    You try the brass knob and discover the door is unlocked. You push it inward and step through the doorway. White gossamer curtains bellow from open windows in a morning breeze at either side of the four-poster bed. Lying on the mattress, her black curls matted to her pillow with blood, is your mother. Her dark brown eyes stare into nothing and her jaw hangs slack.             \n\n     Already pounding in your chest, your heart starts banging a mad percussion. You feel your skin shiver with cold perspiration as a wave of dizziness washes through your skull. Pull yourself together! you think, suddenly. I\u2019ve got to make sure father\u2019s okay. You scan the room and notice the bureau to the left of the bed has all its drawers hanging open. At its foot are a pile of your parents\u2019 clothes and the smashed remains of your mother's guitar.\n\n    You glance in the bureau mirror and see a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl with with shoulder-length locks and bangs that don't quite hide a knitted brow, dripping with sweat. She looks small, frightened, and alone. \n", "Hide from The Rocket Men and Consider Your Options": "It\u2019s obvious whoever did this is looking for something. You scan the rest of the room. The only thing left is the closet door. You realize it\u2019s not fully closed but opened a crack. Concerned the men are probably still here, you head for the closet, open the door and step in. The floor is littered with clothes and wooden hangers. On the top shelf above the clothes racks are a series of overturned cardboard boxes with their contents spilled out. You touch your hand to the door handle and gently pull the closet door shut.                       \n\n    Esmeralda was right. You shouldn't have gone running up to the house. What had you expected to find? Certainly not your mother sprawled out on her bed. What about your father? It seems now that any attempts at heroics wouldn't be of any help to him but might get you killed. But whoever these horrible men are, they're finished with this room. And you\u2019ve got to do something. In the dark, though, you can't help but to feel a wave of coldness wash over your insides. You put a hand to you face and feel tears running down your cheeks.\n\n    Then you remember when you were a little girl during the downpours of the rainy season when you'd hide in your bedroom closet at night, wishing the thunder and lightning would stop, until Xavier, the butler, would come in and hold you in his mechanical arms and say: \n\n    \"Don't be afraid, Mistress Sandra. It's just an electrical storm, and I run on electricity. We'll weather the storm together....\"\n\n    And what was your mother always told you? When your heart is full of fear, that\u2019s when you should make up your mind to act.\n\n    You grab the door handled and walk out into the master bedroom. No one else is here. You decide to chance stepping out into the hallway when a sudden shuffling sound alerts you to the open windows. Crouching below the one nearest the closet door, you pull back a small section of curtain and peak out.\n\n    Walking across the lawn below you are four men dressed in flack jackets and khaki pants, two in the lead and two carrying what looks like a steamer trunk. One of the men in the lead is tall and has red hair, graying sideburns, and a mustache. He seems familiar to you, but you\u2019re not sure where you\u2019ve seen him before.\n\n    \u201cHey, Jay,\u201d says one of the men carrying the trunk.\n\n    The red-haired men looks back. \u201cWhat is it, Burton?\u201d\n\n    \u201cAre you sure the documents are in this trunk? I\u2019d hate us to have to lug this thing all the way to the rocket ship and the papers turn out not to be in here. It\u2019s bad enough we had to kill them. But now my back\u2019s hurting!\u201d\n\n    As if to emphasize his point, Burton drops his end of the steamer trunk. The man with him yelps in pain as the trunk slams onto his foot. He hops around, holding his booted foot in his hand.\n\n    \u201cThanks, Burton, you stupid bastard!\u201d he growls.\n\n    Jay scowls, strides up to Burton, and smacks him in the face. \u201cGet yourself together, man! If you\u2019ve worked in the mines 15 years with no complaint, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re going to start whining about your back all of a sudden. Now both of you pick up the trunk and let\u2019s get back to the ship.\u201d\n\n    You let go the curtain. You need to find your father. Yes, he must be dead now, given what Jay said. But he always carried his keys on him. Including the one for the gun cabinet.\n\n    You hurry down the hall till you get to the other end where your father had his study. The door is open and you walk in to find all the books from the shelves piled onto the ground. Behind his mahogany desk is your father, curled up in his leather chair, his face a charred, bony mass with bulging eyes framed by his iron-gray hair. With shock, you realize they must have shot him point-blank with a ray gun. Your skin goes cold and you feel like vomiting, but you take several deep, slow breaths, close your eyes for a moment, then walk behind the desk and search his gray tweed jacket. It\u2019s so unsettling when your hands brush up against his cold chest, but soon you find his keys in an inner pocket and pull them out.\n\n    \u201cYoung Lady!\u201d\n\n         You start at the sound of Esmeralda\u2019s metallic voice and look at her standing in the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m on edge as it is.\u201d\n\n         The robot scuttles into the study. \u201cWe must go, Sandra. I am deeply, truly sorry about your parents. They were good people and they didn't deserve this fate. But you can\u2019t stay here. Those men might come back. We must get away from this island.\u201d\n\n         You look at her with resolve in your eyes. \u201cYou want to make yourself useful, robot? Here!\u201d You toss the key ring at Esmeralda and it jangles as she instantly catches it in her claw. \u201cGo downstairs to the gun cabinet and collect as many weapons as you can.\u201d\n\n         \u201cSandra, what is it you have planned? I don\u2019t want you running recklessly into harm\u2019s way in some vain attempt at re--\u201d\n\n         \u201cDo it! That\u2019s an order!\u201d\n\n         Esmeralda silently leaves the room.  \n", "Confrontation at the Rocket": "You search the study just a few seconds more and then leave. On the first floor you meet Esmeralda in the parlor room where she stands to one side of the now-open gun cabinet. On the purple carpet in front of the cabinet are the smoldering remains of Xavier. There's a blackened crater in his chest plate and his limbs are sprawled out, one of his gloved hands still twitching with an electrical buzz. He must have been trying to help your family weather the storm. You look down at his egg-shaped head and regard the penciled mustachioed face painted on its front and think those brown eyes never looked so sad. In some ways, you realize, he was more of a true father to you than the dead man in the study.\n\n    \"In keeping with your request, Sandra,\" says Esmeralda, \"I have opened the gun cabinet.\"\n\n    You regard the remains of the butler for a moment longer, glance up at the open gun case, and say: \"Get two pistols and a riffle.\"\n\n    \"Sandra, don't you think it would be better to contact the authorities? Facing these men could be dangerous.\"\n\n    \"Esmeralda, when this is all over, I want you to tell me why you didn't come to the aid of my parents. It's obvious you knew something was likely to go down.\"\n\n    \"I had to think of your safety, my dear. As your tutor, it is my primary programming to see to your best interests over all--\"\n\n    \"Get the guns out, already!\"\n\n    You and Esmeralda leave the house and march in the direction your parents murderers headed. After passing through a vined copse of trees, you both enter a large meadow. In its center is the rocket ship. But it's not an average ship. No, it's a witch ship. It's fish-shaped hull is painted black and across its side is the lenticular image of a beautiful raven-haired witch on a broomstick. She bobs up and down and her hair and cape dance in an imaginary wind as you approach. \n\n    Why would they come in an old war-ship? They must be hired guns. And yet you seem to remember their leader, Jay, from somewhere...\n\n    Before you can consider any further, there is a loud rumbling from the craft and the atomic motors at its rear light up. It's taking off! You take the heat rifle you've been holding and aim at the ship as it slowly ascends. Without thinking, you pull the trigger and a blinding beam of blue light lances from your weapon and burns into the hull. The animated witch still bobs, smiling, as the plastic film she's embedded in smolders away, exposing the steel plating underneath. Soon the plating glows orange and then rips open. Sparks burst from the ship's open wound and the craft starts bobbing up and down like the witch it's named for.\n\n    There's a loud explosion...\n", "Destruction's Wake": "The acrid smell of smoke burns your nostrils as you come to. Esmeralda is gently tapping the side of your cheek with her claw when your eyes open. You sit up to see the smoldering wreckage of the rocket ship. Much of the grass in the meadow has been scorched black and smoking chunks of the ship's hull are scattered about.  \n\n    Then  you notice the dead men on the ground. All three of them have dried blood smeared on their mouths and chins and they all appear to have had their necks broken. \n\n    You look to Esmeralda. \"Did you kill them?\"\n\n    The robot's eyes fade to a pale shade of crimson. \"I'm afraid I had little choice in the matter, Mistress Sandra. You were knocked unconscious and they were approaching with their ray guns drawn. I was certain that after what you had done to their ship, they would surely have murdered you.\"\n\n    \"My God...\" You catch your breath. \"You must have snapped their necks!\"\n\n    \"I regret being forced to resort to such uncivil measures, my dear, but your defense is my top priority.\"\n\n    You try to stand and immediately feel a stabbing pain in your left knee. You look at it and see that it's dripping blood. \n\n    Esmeralda supports you with her arms. \"There, there. You've been injured in several places, including your head.\"\n\n    You touch a hand to a stinging part of you forehead, only to find blood on your fingers. \"I...I didn't think your programming allowed you to kill people.\"\n\n    Esmeralda hefts you up off your feet and starts carrying you in the direction of the house. \"Under circumstances such as these, I'm justified in killing to preserve a life.\"\n\n    Your head bobs back and sunlight dazzles your eyes. \"Where are you taking me?\"\n\n    \"Back to the house, Mistress Sandra. I need to nurse your injuries as well as contact the authorities.\"\n\n    The sunlight is blotted out by a canopy of tree branches. You feel like a drunken sailor on a swaying ship as the robot carries you to your home. \"I...don't know what good it would be to contact the Marshal for these regions. He's probably on the other end of the continent and wouldn't make it to Lozano's Island for days.\"\n\n    \"Nevertheless...\"\n\n    You feel yourself drifting...   \n", "At the Crossroads": "It's been three days since the rocket men came and turned your life inside out. Most of that time you've spent in bed, slowly recovering your health... and musing. \n\n   The house is so quite now. You used to always hear your mother playing her guitar, usually Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D or Bach's Brandenburg Concerto Number Four in G Major. You remember as a child trying to learn guitar theory from her and getting frustrated. Eventually, you found a book that taught you the three-chord trick and quickly mastered the folk standards contained within in its pages. You were so proud that you decided to show your mother, only to feel hurt at the annoyed look on your her face when you did a rendition of Turkey in the Straw.\n\n    That was the last time you ever wanted to play the guitar. \n\n    While you've been bedridden with nothing but memories of the past and thoughts of the future, Esmeralda has been busy nursing you back to health as best she can. She has had to consult several of your father's medical textbooks to learn how to give your head wound stitches-- the suturing itself would have been much more unpleasant had it not been for the bottle of wine the robot retrieved from the kitchen and made you drink before she applied the needle.\n\n    Esmeralda has also discovered that the house radio had been destroyed by the men from the rocket. Additionally, your father's auto gyro is missing from the the landing pad. When Esmeralda informs you about the helicopter, you recall only seeing three bodies by the ship. Wasn't there a forth man?\n\n    Initially, you debate with her on whether or not to bury your parents. You argue it is the only respectful thing to do, but she keeps insisting that their bodies should be left intact for the authorities. \n\n    \"What's the point?\" You ask. \"There's no question as to cause of death, and if we leave my parents' remains out, they'll only rot with the heat and the Venusian fungus.\"\n\n    She eventually partially-relents and wraps the corpses in bed sheets and stows them in the freezer in the kitchen. You decide not to further argue with her on this point. What's important now is considering where you go from here.  \n\n    You ask Esmeralda if she can build some kind of a water craft to get the two of you off of Lozano's Island, and she immediately starts collecting wood and vines from the jungle to build the boat.\n\n    You begin packing cloths into a steel suitcase that you would use when you'd go on trips. In addition to several skirts, blouses, pants, underwear and a pair of hiking boots, you also pack your Catholic school uniform for some reason, too, even though they probably wouldn't want to see your face again. Additionally, you put in hygienic items, such as your toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, tampons, a bar of soap, and deodorant. Realizing you can't get far without currency, you take money from the safe in your father's study. (The door was blown open by the rocket men but they seemed to have had no interest in the stacks of gold coins found therein). While you're in the study, you grab the table-top map of Venus, since that will definitely come in handy on your travels. The last item from the study you take is your father's St. Christopher medal-- now more than ever, you can use the help of the Patron Saint of travelers. From the kitchen you gather bread, cheese, a thermos of drinking water, a box of matches, and a bread knife. At first, you'd considered packing meat, but the thought of opening the freezer deters you. \n\n    Within a week of the incident, Esmeralda announces that she's finished the boat. You examine it where bobs in the lagoon waters next to the old pier. The boat looks a little rough in places and the tree branches making up its hull are only secured with vines, but Esmeralda assures you she's made it water-tight using a resin she's fashioned from tree sap. You and the robot climb in and place your belongings in the stern. Esmeralda unties the craft from the pier and uses a long, crude-looking oar to punt the boat out of the lagoon. \n\n    \"Well,\" she asks you, \"where should we go?\"\n\n    Where indeed? Straus's Island is closer than the mainland and it is the unofficial port of call for traders and ships for hire. You know that many of those rocket ships are decommissioned witch ships from the old Martian wars of the late 70's and early 80's. You might be able to check the records for the ship those men came in. It could be the only lead you might have for finding the missing man. \n\n    You recall that the red-haired man mentioned that the other man worked in the mines. That could only mean the copper mine on the continent. You know there must be some connection between your parents' murders and your father's company. You remember the red-haired man from somewhere...\n\n    And then there's Ursuline Academy. Why else would you have packed your uniform? Margaret Sullivan has been on your mind a lot, lately. You miss her terribly, even though it was your confession to Father Micheal that got you expelled. At least you never named names. As far as you know, she's still attending the school. If you could have anyone in your corner right now, it'd definitely be her. It's also not far from the copper mine.\n\n \n", "Go to Straus's Island": "The rocking of the boat is beginning to get to you by the second day out to sea. Esmeralda's rapid rowing only makes your seasickness worse, but you still insist she keep up a steady pace. You've discovered that doing normally simple things like bathing and relieving yourself has become extremely challenging and unpleasant. And all the while the constant sloshing of the waves and the perpetual white mist in all directions fills you with a sense of encroaching madness. What was it Thoreau said? Men live lives of quiet desperation. That seems to sum up nicely this white watery hellscape.\n\n    Sometimes you alleviate your ennui by discussing various esoteric topics with Esmeralda. Her vast encyclopedic knowledge of so many different subjects is always fascinating to you. But you usually avoid bringing up the subject of your parents. You realize your robot tutor knows more about what happened than she's let on, but you feel reluctant to broach the subject. It's still too soon. You'll have plenty of time to go into such matters when you reach Straus's Island and its famous (some would say infamous) rocket port, Coventown. Plus, you feel a little guilty for how you've treated Esmeralda. It doesn't seem right for you to have laid a guilt trip on her over your parents' death when she'd just been trying to make sure you were safe. Why feel so guilty over a robot? Maybe it's your Catholic upbringing.\n\n    Maybe that's why you confessed to Father Micheal that you were attracted to girls and wound up getting yourself kicked out of Ursuline Academy. Wasn't the priest supposed to honor the sanctity of the confessional and not tell? How could such feelings even be a sin...\n\n    There is a loud splashing off in the distance. You look up past the stern of the boat, only to see more of the infernal white mist.\n\n    \"Esmeralda,\" you ask. \"what was that sound?\"\n\n    The robot stops her rowing and turns her head forward. \"I don't know, Sandra. But it sounded like something large. Waite. I hear something else.\"\n\n    \"What?\"\n\n    \"Something is shifting the currents beneath the waters. I can tell it's very big.\"\n\n    \"How big?\"\n\n    \"I'd say about the size of an ocean liner.\"\n\n    You feel a chill on your skin. \"Do you think...could it be a leviathan?\"\n\n    Esmeralda's head turns toward you. \"I'm afraid that's a distinct possibility, Sandra. It's heading in our direction. I would estimate it should be beneath the boat in a about five minutes.\"\n\n    You instinctively press your back into the bow of the craft. \"Esmeralda, is there a possibility it will just pass beneath us without bothering the boat?\"\n\n    \"It may...or it might detect us and attack. They navigate with sonar; as long as it's not calling, it probably won't notice us.\" \n\n    \"Could we just paddle out of its range?\"\n\n    \"I would not advise such a line of activity, young lady. That would surely alert the beast of our presence. I advise we stop talking now.\"\n\n    You sit in the boat for about a minute without saying a word. The waves slosh against the hull and fall off in tiny trickles. The only other sound is your shallow breathing. You stare into the sky and see dead white. The shear nothingness of it all seems to compress your insides like a cold vice. You reach for the ray rifle from where it lies at the bottom of the boat. \n\n    A faint, shrill pulsing comes from beneath. The sound increases in volume. It's like the churring of an insect or maybe some kind of electrical machine. To your horror you see that the water your floating in is now dimpled with coin-sized  craters. Then you notice something gray-white is just beneath the surface. There is an explosion of water off to the side of the boat. You look to see a large, rubbery tentacle rising from the water like a huge cobra. \n\n    You grip the cold metal of the gun.\n\n    What can you do?     \n", "Inaction is the Safest Policy": "Terrified to do anything that might agitate the creature, you lay back in the boat, close your eyes tightly, and press your hands to your ears. You can still make out the high-pitched pulsing sound, but now that you've damped out some of its shriller qualities with your palms you notice a lower register to the leviathan's sonar song. It's a kind of rapid thumping that makes your whole body seem to spin. After a while, you start loosing track of time completely. Purple swirls of phosphorous dots spiral away into darkness in front of your closed eyes. You want to look around you, but it's as if your limbs have gone numb. You feel yourself drifting...\n", "Awakening": "You pull yourself off of the cold wooden floorboards and stand up and look about you. You are on a dark plain that recedes to a twilit gray horizon. Off to the northeast is the dark silhouette of a mansion with several gables. You can't make out too many other details since the house looks like it was cut from black construction paper and pasted onto the dark overcast, but you can see one window radiating light. You look down at the plain you're standing on and realize it could be the cold gray planks of a stage. There are no trees. There is no grass. No roads. The only other thing you notice is a chill, gentle breeze prickling your skin.\n\n    You remember that you had been doing something important...\n\n    Three more windows light up on the house and suddenly you can make out a tall door on the ground level of the building. It's dark at first, but then a rectangular rim of light frames its edges. The door opens inward  and the light from behind it dazzles your eyes. You see the dark figure of a woman standing in the doorway. You feel her calling to you, but it's inside your head.\n\n    Should you accept her invitation?\n", "Join the Woman in the House": "As you approach the mansion, you notice more details about it's makeup. The side facing you seems made of bricks and wood planks, but everything is painted black. The door the woman opened is closed again and is at ground level to the gray boards of the plain with no steps leading up to it. The windows are blazing with a harsh white light, but you can't see the interior due to glowing gossamer drapes. You approach the door and see that its black surface is carved with a vine-like filigree which frames a carving of the one-eyed god Hephaestus. Suddenly, you realize it's like the door of your father's study. You feel a wave of unease wash coldly through your body as you rap your knuckles on the door.\n\n    The door immediately creaks open and standing before you in the blazing light of the interior is Margaret Sullivan. She's smiling and wearing the blue blazer and matching skirt of the Ursuline Academy.\n\n    \"Sandra,\" she says with unmoving lips, \"glad you could make it. I'm here with your parents and we're about to have dinner. Follow me and I'll show you to the dinning room.\"\n\n    She steps back and you join her inside the house. Crossing the threshold causes the light to dim and you find yourself in a plum-colored room with wine-red carpeting. The furniture is covered with white sheets as if to keep the dust off it. You look to Margaret and open your arms to hug her, but that's when you notice her face is strange. In a moment you realize that she's wearing a painted wooden mask made to look like her real face.\n\n    \"Margaret, why are you wearing a mask?\"\n\n    There is a frown on her mask. \"You don't like it?\" \n\n    \"Oh, did you make it yourself?\"\n\n    \"I didn't say anything about making it. Silly, my talents are in drawing and painting.\"\n\n    She steps out of the room and you follow her through an arch into what seems to be the dinning room. It is a long room with a long table draped in a white tablecloth and set in flickering candelabras and silver covered dishes. Sitting in plum velvet chairs on either side at the far end of the table are your mother and father. They also wear painted wooden masks shaped to look like their faces. They look to the two of you as you enter and stand up.\n\n    Your mother comes up to you and puts her hand on your cheek. \"Sandra, my dear. It's been too long. How have you been?\"\n\n    \"Mother...I thought...No, I don't remember. There was something.\" You place your fingers on your temple trying to recall...what?\n\n    \"Come, we're about to have dinner.\" She returns to her seat and you find a place next to her with Margaret taking a chair on your other side. \"Your little schoolmate Margaret her has told us all about he two of you.\" \n\n    \"Oh?\" you ask, your whole body suddenly feeling clammy with cold sweat. \"What-- um, what has she said?\"\n\n    Your father reaches for a flask on the table and pours plum-red wine into a silver goblet by his plate. He places the goblet to his mouth and wine dribbles down the wooden chin of his mask. A pool of purple liquid spreads through the white tablecloth before him.\n\n    The candlelight casts dancing shadows onto the contours of your mother's mask. There is a contented, knowing grin carved into that wooden face.\n\n    \"Just,\" says your mother, \"what a wonderful friend you are to her. How the two of you spend so much time together at school. You're both so inseparable. Almost like sisters.\"\n\n    \"Oh,\" you sigh. \"Yes, we are pretty close.\"\n\n    Your mother pours herself wine, places the goblet to her lips, and lets it spill down her throat and onto the front of her light blue evening dress. \"But not like sisters. I think the two of you are cute together.\"\n\n    Margaret pulls up a large wooden box from her lap and hands it to you. \"Here, Sandra. I got you a present.\"\n\n    You examine the box. Coming out of one end is a rusty metal crank. Each side of the box has a carved green diamond on a red face. You turn it over and see that front says Jack in the Box in bright purple letters.\n\n    Margaret gently squeezes your shoulder. \"Well, aren't you going to turn the crank?\"\n\n    You comply with her wishes and rotate the crank. A plinking metallic rendition of Pop Goes the Weasel comes from the box. Then the lid at the top pops open and a rusted metal spring jumps out. \n\n    \"Shouldn't there be a Jack?\" you ask.\n\n    \"Oh, don't worry, love,\" says Margaret, caressing your lower lip with her finger. \"He's coming.\"  \n", "Turn Away from the House and Start Walking": "You nervously turn your back to the dark house and began walking in the opposite direction. Before you are the grey floorboards that stretch to the dim, gray horizon. There are no real landmarks, other than an occasional floorboard that's paler or darker than the others or has more conspicuous dark nail-heads hammered into it. You do notice that the cloudy overcast of the sky undulates like smoke and that after a while you can start to make out dancing patterns in it. After what seems like hours of staring at the changing patterns in the dark sky, you pull your head down and stare at the floorboards instead. You notice that the air has gotten chillier and that the breeze is stronger, more cutting. You begin rubbing your arms with your hands and notice goosebumps on your skin.\n\n    Always, always, you're trying to remember what you were doing before you woke up here. You were going somewhere and there was another endless sea... liquid, smelling of salt... that's all that seems to come to mind.\n\n\n    You hear an old woman's voice cackle shrilly in the distance. You look up from the floorboards and stare about you, unsure where the cackle came from. That's when you notice something new on the horizon. They are far away but you can tell that they're tall and thin and dark against the cloudy backdrop of the sky. Trees? Yes, trees... No, mushrooms. Martian mushrooms. Those grow tall in the caverns under the surface of Mars. The surface of that planet is desolate and only inhabited by the Martians' robots. But there are miles and miles of caverns beneath the Red Planet's top-layer. Where the Martians live. And these tall, tall mushrooms. As you near them, they tower over your head like oaks or redwoods. Soon you're in a forest of mushrooms.\n\n    You step under the canopy of a mushroom and touch its stem. It's as wide as a bungalow, but that's not what surprises you. No, you're surprised by the cold texture of the stem. It's not spongy and moist like you remember from when you visited Mars as a child, but solid and rough. Like painted wood. You rap on the surface of the stem with your knuckles and realize it is wood. Hollow wood.\n\n    There's another cackle, this time nearer. You dart your head around to see who uttered the evil laugh. All you see are the rows and rows of fake mushrooms spreading out across the stage-land. A cold gust of wind ruffles your cloths and you see a large shadow flitting across the floorboards beyond the shade of your mushroom. The old woman's voice cackles again. You step out of the shade of the mushroom and look in the direction you heard the laugh. Then you see her.\n\n    She's giant, airborne, and crouched on a ragged-looking broom, her black cloak fluttering behind her. A witch. You squint your eyes and notice that there are thick black wires on either end of the broomstick holding her aloft. You glance up at the sky and see the two wires stretch up into the cloud layers until they are lost from view. She's flying away from you but suddenly curves her broom at an angle and turns back in your direction. Before you realize it, she's hovering over you, blotting out most of the dim light from the sky.\n\n    Her green skin has a faint luminescence that lights her features like a blue-tinted flashlight held from below. Her nose is long and crooked and covered in boils, warts, and hairy moles. Her eyes are yellow and glazed. She smiles down at you with a wide mouth full of jagged, broken teeth.\n\n    \"Well my deary,\" her booming voice echoes, \"we can't have you herey. You're Earth-born like me so we can't douse you in flames.\"\n\n    \"I'm not Earth-born,\" you say. \"I'm a native of Venus.\"\n\n    \"No matter, little girl. A spawn of Man and Woman I may not burn. Here,\" she reaches a giant hand down over your head, fingers splayed, \"let me take you from here.\"\n\n    You want to run, but where?\n", "Head Back to the Mushroom Stem": "The giant witch is closing in on you faster and faster and you don't want to be out in the open where there's no place to hide. You run to the mushroom stem, hoping the head of the mushroom will block the crone's view of you. You're moving so fast you smash head-long into the stem, splintering wood as you penetrate the barrier. It's black inside the stem. You turn back to look through the opening to see if the witch is still coming for you. Blackness meets your shocked eyes. Frantically,  you try looking around you to see if there is any way out or any kind of light source...           \n\n    You push through the darkness, but not with your body. Just by your will alone.            \n\n    Groggily, you open your eyes.           \n\n    Harsh white light shines down on you. You blink several times and then turn your head to the side. You realize there's a pillow underneath your head.          \n\n\n    Oh, you think, relieved, it was all a bad dream....          \n\n    Your eyes focus on a white wall banded with a ribbon window. Through the window you can see men and women in white coats walking back and forth. Beyond them you notice giant rectangular tanks of water. And swimming in those tanks are Leviathans! The creatures sway their fluked tails and grasp at the surface of the water with their tentacles.         \n\n    You turn your head back to the bright light and notice there are red, blue, and green wires hanging down over you. You tentatively place a hand to them and tug, and feel tape pulling on the skin of your forehead.          \n\n    What's going on? You're in a bed, there are electrodes taped to your head, and there appear to be scientists beyond the room you're in attending to those giant sea creatures. Then you realize you're not lying on a blanket. No, it's warm and soft and yielding...like flesh. You sit up and look down. A kind of gray, fleshy cocoon is wrapped around your mid-section and legs. It's thick network of veins pulse with an eerie green light.         \n\n    A door squeaks on its hinges and a man's voice says: \"What? You're up?\"        \n\n    You look past the foot of your \"bed\" and see a tall, gray-haired black man with a beard. He's wearing a white lab coat and a red neck tie and holding a clipboard under one arm. His eyes stare wide with shock.        \n\n    \"How did you wake up?\" he asks in what your realize is a Jamaican accent. \"Do you know where you are, girl?\"          \n\n    You try to pull your thoughts together, but almost everything in your head is mental haze. \"No...No idea.  What...is...all...this?\"     The man steps up to you and reaches over you head, making adjustments on what appear to be banks of machines behind you. \"You shouldn't have come out of your stupor, young girl. I'll have to note this.\" He pulls a pen out of his breast pocket and writes something on the clipboard. \"It's only been five years.\"            \n\n\n    \"Five years?\"        \n\n    \"Since the Leviathan caught  you. We were tracking it and noticed it intercepting a small boat. We've kept it here ever since, monitoring your state.\"        \n\n\n    \"I've been unconscious for....five years?\"        \n\n    \"You weren't supposed to come out. That wasn't part of the plan. We removed the creature's inner membrane to better study you. You're still connected to the leviathan, though. Look.\"       \n\n    He points above and behind you. Beyond the banks of machines lies a transparent water tank with a leviathan swimming inside. A series of membranous tissues web from over the rim of the tank and connect their tendrils to the flesh cocoon your body is embedded in.       \n\n    You gasp in shock. \"Let me out of here!\"       \n\n    The scientist grins down at you and shakes his head sadly. \"No, no, girl. That would go against orders from higher up. Project Gilgamesh needs to see how long a human being can live inside a leviathan membrane.\"       \n\n    He pulls a syringe out of his coat pocket and grabs one of your arms.       \n\n    \"What are you doing?\" you ask in terror.       \n\n    \"Don't worry, girl. This hypo should only knock you unconscious.\" A thoughtful look crosses his face. \"Well, we've never actually tried a sedative on a human subject in a membrane. Either you'll go back to your dream world...or maybe your troubles will be over.\"       \n\n    You scream in pain as the needle stabs into a vein.      \n\n    Soon you feel no more discomfort. Soon everything is calm, peaceful.      \n\n    And you never dream again...                                                                                 \n\n\n                                                        The End \n", "Run Till You're Beyound the Mushroom Forest": "Your feet clack on the gray floor boards as the giant witch cackles behind you. Soon the last of the tall mushroom stems passes you by and you are on yet another flat plain with dark, roiling clouds overhead. The witch's laugh becomes dimmer and dimmer until you realize she must have given up on you and flown away in the opposite direction. Just keep walking, you think.\n\n\n       After what seems like an hour, you realize there are no more landmarks. Everything is barren, empty. A cold, cold breeze prickles your flesh and you hug yourself with your arms. You look above you and see nothing but dark gray clouds. Crestfallen, you sit down on the \"stage\" and close your eyes. You can't recall what your were doing before you woke up in this purgatory. Yet you feel a constant sense of loss. What is it? you wonder. What happened before I got here?\n\n\n      Opening your eyes again, you scan the horizon in all directions. Off in the distance is the silhouette of the house. The windows are blazing a hot white light and the doorway glows invitingly, the strange woman still standing there, cutting a dark figure against the light of the interior. Should you go in? \n", "Close Your Eyes, Lie Down, and Rest": "You don't know where you are or what's going on. Not anymore. Nothing makes sense now. You're tired. You lay your head on the floor boards and shut your eyes. The wind is chilly, but you focus on the purple spirals of dark light. Just rest here a minute, you think. Every second in that minute last a day and a night.\n\n\n        Then you notice your body has turned to liquid and is seeping into the wood grain of the floor boards. You feel a vast sense of relief. Soon there won't be anything left of you to have so much as one single care in the world...\n\n\n \n\n                                                                   The End\n\n\n \n"}, "tree": {"Child of the Mourning Star": {"In the House": {"Hide from the Rocket Men and Consider Your Options": {"Confrontation at the Rocket": {"Destruction's Wake": {"At the Crossroads": {"Go to Straus's Island": {"Inaction is the safest policy": {"Awakening": {"Join the Woman in the House": {"Waiting for Jack": "END"}}}, "Turn Away from the House and Start Walking": {"Head Back to the Mushroom Stem": "END", "Run Till You're Beyound the Mushroom Forest": {"Join the Woman in the House": "END", "Close Your Eyes, Lie Down, and Rest": "END"}}}, "Turn Away from the House and Start Walking": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Bounty Hunter", "stories": {"Landing": "Your ship lands on a platform.

The second has several odd funguses lining its walls.  The Ugla probably eat the fungus, so the tunnel with the fungus would probably have the most Ugla.

Pain shoots through your body, from where you had been shot, but it feels more like a non-lethal stun weapon than a bullet or laser wound. Glancing about, you realise you are strapped to an interrogation chair, sort of like a folding bed, put into an upright sitting position.\n", "Examine the room": "You try to take in your surroundings, but bright lights above and in front of you make it hard to see anything past the glare. You hear the sound of a door slide open, and then footsteps approach from behind you.\n\n\"Ah, he has awoken,\" says Nasal Voice.\n\n\"We must find out where the rebels are hiding,\" says Rough Voice.\n\n\"Do not worry, I can make anyone talk,\" Nasal Voice replies with a soft chuckle.\n", "\"I won't tell you anything!\" you tell them.": "\"You will tell us everything, and more,\" Nasal Voice promises you ominously.\n\n\"Tell me when you get anything useful,\" Gruff Voice says, and you hear footsteps retreating behind you. You hear the door slide open again, and then close as he leaves.\n\n\"Subject Two, tell me where the rebels are hiding,\" Nasal Voice demands softly.\n", "You don't say a word.": "\"Well,\" Nasal Voice says sadly, \"We have ways of making you talk.\"\n\nA metal robotic arm whines as it moves out in front of your body from off to one side of the chair. Instead of a hand, there is a spherical object, with needles protruding from it. Your eyes open wide as the metal arm suddely thrusts at your chest, impaling you on the small needles. You feel liquids rushing into you, and suddenly a wave of dizziness comes over you. You black out.\n\nSome time later, you wake up, feeling achey and stiff all over. You are still strapped to the interrogation chair, bright lights shining around you. You listen for a few moments, but can not hear anyone else in the room with you. Of course, not being able to see behind you, Nasal Voice could still be there.\n\nLooking down at your arms, you wonder if you could pull free of the leather straps that bind you to the chair.\n", "Try to break the straps that bind your arms in place.": "You try to flex your arms, pulling against the leather straps, and testing their strength. The straps don't budge. You strain on and off for a few minutes, and then Nasal Voice whispers into your ear from behind you.\n\n\"Are you ready to continue our conversation? I so enjoyed our last talk. We have moved on Cell Four and your rebel friends there have been eliminated. Now, would you like to tell me where the other Cells are hiding?\"\n\nCell four? Eliminated? That's not possible, you think. You told them nothing! Another wave of dizziness comes over you, and your head droops for a moment before clearing.\n\n\"Come now, you don't want another dose of medicine, do you?\" Nasal Voice asks. \"Tell me where the rest of your rebel friends are hiding, and you will spend the rest of this war in comfort.\"\n", "No, you think, it's some sort of trick. I'm not saying a word!": "\"Very well, Subject Two, have it your own way,\" Nasal Voice says. The robotic arm suddenly moves back into view. You flinch instinctively, but the straps hold you in place. Suddenly the arm swats against your chest, impaling you once more on the injections. You feel sick in your stomach as unknown fluids are pumped into you, and then you black out again.\n\nYou awaken, somewhat groggily, an unknown period of time later. However, you are surprised to see you are on a bunk, in a small prison cell. The door is solid, with a small barred window in it, about two-hands tall and wide, at head height.\n\nWas the interrogation over? Or were they going to come back for you at a later time?\n", "Look through the window in the door.": "You go over to the door, and peer through the small barred window. You step back in surprise, as another pair of eyes was looking back at you from the other side.\n\n\"Subject Two is ready,\" Snide Voice says from the other side of the door. Suddenly you blink, and find yourself strapped to the interrogation chair. How did you get there? What just happened?\n\nNasal Voice talks pleasantly from behind the chair, \"Ah, Subject Two, I so enjoy our talks. Now the Rebel Cells, Four and Five, are no longer a threat, and we have no one to thank but you. You have been ever so helpful to us. So, are you ready to tell us where the first three Cells are hiding?\"\n\nWhat? Two of the Cells have been captured - or killed? It can't be, he must be messing with you. You would never betray your friends!\n", "You don't say a word. They're getting nothing out of you!": "\"Fine, it works either way. I just wanted it to go more pleasantly for you,\" Nasal Voice says, sounding apologetic. You want to wring his neck. The robotic arm comes out from beside you, and you suddenly can't help but flinch with fear as it smacks the injections against your chest, and pumps strange fluids into you. You black out almost straight away.\n\nYou awaken in the prison cell again. No wait, you think - wasn't the door on the other side of the room last time? Maybe it is a different cell. There is a small window at head-height in the door, just as before.\n\nThen you notice there is a person in the room with you, a young woman huddling in the corner of the prison cell. She looks up at you, seeing you are awake.\n\n\"I won't tell you people a thing,\" she tells you venomously.\n", "\"I'm not one of them, I'm a prisoner too,\" you assure her.": "\"What did you do to get thrown in this place?\" she asks cautiously.\n", "\"I'm one of the rebels. I got captured,\" you explain.": "\"Really? I'm a rebel too! I was with Cell Four, but government troops raided our hiding place and captured us all a couple days ago,\" she tells you.\n\nYou don't know whether she is telling the truth or not. You know some of the rebels in each of the five Cells, but not all of them, so you can't be certain. Your interrogator, Nasal Voice, had said that they had eliminated Cells Four and Five. Could it be true?\n", "It's probably a trap, you think. You decide not to speak to her.": "You ignore her. She must be a government spy, put into the cell with you, to make you talk. Suddenly you hear footsteps outside, and the door swings open. Two big men wiedling stun batons walk into the room. One of them stands in front of you, and the other goes over to the woman. He kicks her, and shouts at her, \"Tell us the rebel password!\"\n\nShe cries out in pain, and clutches at her side. The guard in front of you grins down at you, standing between you and the others.\n\n\"I'm not telling a thing!\" the woman shouts. The guard begins hitting her with his baton, and you hear electric zaps as it strikes her body.\n", "It's just an act. Let them beat her up.": "You wait for her to fall unconcious. The guards grunt in satisfaction, and then leave the room, and slam the door shut behind them. Suddenly you feel dizzy and black out.\n\nYou awaken on the interrogation chair, bright lights shining down on you from above.\n\n\"This is getting us nowhere!\" Rough Voice says from behind you.\n\n\"Let's try something else,\" Nasal Voice says. \"I always get the information... eventually.\"\n\n\"He's useless. Let's just kill him, and get another prisoner,\" Rough Voice says.\n\n\"No, I can get him to talk. I'll just have to take things to the next level,\" Nasal Voice says.\n\n\"All right, I'll be back later,\" Rough Voice says. You hear him walking away from you. You hear a door slide open as he leaves, and then slides shut.\n\nThe robotic arm swings into view again, and then punches injections into your chest. You cry out as strange fluids flow into your body, and black out.\n\nYou awaken back in the cell with the woman. She is waking up at the same time as you, and groggily sits up, clutching her side in pain. She looks at you and smiles. \"You look as beat up as me. Maybe you aren't working for the government after all. Who are you?\"\n", "Attack the guard in front of you, try to get the stun baton off of him.": "You wait for the guard in front of you to glance toward the other guard and the girl, then you launch into action. You stand up, bringing your hands down in a chopping motion at the guard's neck. He crumples unconcious to the ground, and as he falls, you pull the stun baton out of his hand. The other guard shoves the girl aside, and stands before you wielding his stun baton, ready for a fight.\n", "Wait for him to attack, then sidestep him and smack him in the side of the head with the baton!": "You wait for him to lunge forward, and then you quickly dive to one side, and swing around, smashing him in the side of the head with your baton. The baton makes a loud electric 'zzzz' sound as it shocks him, and he collapses unconcious beside the first guard. The woman looks at you appraisingly, and then says, \"Okay, maybe you're not one of them after all... but how are we going to get out of here?\"\n\nShe picks up the other stun baton, and looks at you for directions. You glance toward the open doorway.. no wait, it was on the other side of the room. You glance at the open doorway, and listen for any other guards, but hear nothing but silence from the hall outside the prison cell.\n", "\"Come on.\" You head out into the hallway.": "The hallway heads south, and strangely there are no other cell doors. You head down the hallway, and come to a door at the end. Windows in the door show a large outdoor courtyard. It appears to be night time, but strobing search lights fash across the courtyard now and then.\n", "Wait to see what happens.": "You sit on the bed, and hours seem to go by.

We recheck the address then ring the bell.\n\nFew days ago...\n\nThere are many pros of being a private detective in a post-apocalyptic world. Since, everyone is so busy trying to scrape that last piece of food from the tin, there is not much competition, if any. Cases are plentyful and not cliche`. I mean really, who gives a damn if someone dies. People would be merrier to loot him than to report.\n\n\nThere was a letter on my desk. It looked more like a piece of rag than paper but the writing was crystal clear.\n\n\"333/6D Avenue - Sunday 26\" it said.\n\nOne wouldn't really investigate this unless ofcourse the given address is of a rich and lucky man. Not that being rich mattered anymore.\n\nThe world blew itself centuries ago. People said it was inevitable. Some protested until ofcouse the bombs blew them to kingdom come. I am not really sure about the rest of the world but USA has now very well become a damn shithole. Although, it never ceases to amaze me how quick mankind sprang back on its feet.\n\n\nThe door was answered by an old, short man. He looked us up and down then demanded our cause. We smiled.\n\n\nThe owner of the bunglow was a tall, handsome man as one would expect. A six inch smile was plastered on his face as he gaped at us for what seemed like forever. He insisted that I meet him alone. I nodded.\n\n\nI came out and It took me about two minutes to inform James of the situation.\n\n\"So, he wants us to find his lost son. And in return we would get money, right.\" he said.\n\"Pretty much, except that there is a catch.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I mean...\"\n\nI started the car and lit a cigar.\n\n\"...that his son is already dead.\"\n\nIt is only a matter of time before my luck runs out - I thought. I have been doing weired things since the day I was born and had always managed to escape unharmed. Not this time , something told me. I could happily walk away...but then again, where would I go.\n", "Accept Job": "Where would I go. Hah! Where else!? I lit another cigar and pulled the car infront of a decrepit building. A neon red board hung from its hinges, and mangled in cobwebs, read - Ellikita Barz.\n\nThe keeper greeted us on the enterance, his hands outstreched, his body limp, a knife protruding from his chest, lying in a pool of stinking blood.\n\n\"Things change quickly, don't they.\" James remarked and followed me into the bar.\n\nWhat looked like a piece of trash from the outside, was a booze heaven inside - someone once told me. I guess he framed that line after visiting this place. The place was filled with smog and sadness, served chilled with the odour of alcohol. James helped himself on a table and looked at me.\n\n\"I am not paying.\" I said.\n\"Wha--what do you mean! Oh come on!\"\n\"We are here to investigate. Must keep a fresh mind.\"\n\"...you need to relax man. Not that his son is running away or something.\"\n\nI looked around.\n\n\"What if he is?\"\n\nI reached the counter. An old and beardy man greeted me.\n\n\"Whath in tha world you looking at punk?\" he burped.\n\"Well, my friend over there needs some booze.\"\n\"A booze rigt awa'\"\n\nThis place reeks of crime and sex. I flashed my ID to the old man.\n\n\"Baaw! Like Me giv a sht. Yuu wonht fin' wath yuu luking for here.\"\n\nHowever, after a few punches in the backroom and a few sick signs, he erupts it all.\n\n\"So, they are here? In this club!?\" James kicked his fat belly.\n\n\"Imma gudsake u fukrs burn in hell! Baztrd homo--\"\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!\" James jumps. \"You broke his jaw! Calm down!\"\n\n\"Let us investigate.\"\n\nSoon enough I recognized them. They left the bar soon and we followed them in the shadows. A black car waited for them.\n\n\"You think we should follow?\" James pulls out his gun.\n", "Chase the car": "\"Hell yes! Go.\"\n\nAnd in the dark, rainy night we tailed their headlights. After a few minutes of driving, the car stopped at a big building. They got out and entered the building. The building was lit brightly.\n\nPropped against my car, I lit another cigar.\n\n\"What do you think is in there?\"\n\n\"Probably the boy. Or whatevers left of him.\" I reply.\n\n\"Should we go in?\"\n\n\"No. Atleast not now.\"\n\nAnd there was a silence, except raindrops dripping over the car.\n\n\"Hey have you ever heard the song - My old little rain by Jamie B,\" James asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It reminds me of this. You know. Yellow lights, rainy day, a great atmosphere. The only things lacking is my girl. I wish she was here.\"\n\n\"Is she dead?\"\n\n\"Well, for me, yes.\"\n\n\"Hmph. Here take this.\" I handed him my cigar and lit another one.\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"We go home.\"\n\n\"Just like that?\"\n\n\"Just like that.\"\n\nOur car drove off into the mist.\n", "Return to the building": "\"Is this a stealth mission?\" James tugged at his belt.\n\n\"No. It is clean and sweep.\"\n\n\"So, we kill every one and retrieve the body?\"\n\n\"Pretty much.\"\n\nI put in my revolver and pocket knife while James polished his .55.\nI was pretty sure it was a stupid idea. But we will see.\n\nOur car screeched at the loafty gates. Two guards came to us and asked our names.\n\nWe smiled.\n\nThe building was full of criminals and prostitutes, two of the best job money could buy. I could also see some grumpy fellow who resumbled rich men. It was a party here.\n\n\"Not a good place to keep a body.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\nWhatever we were looking for was probably on the next floor. Now to find a way above.\n\n\"Did they do Tiger-Cat in your days.\" I asked James. He smiled in answer and mixed in the crowd.\n\nThis all reminded me of my child hood self. Even in this grim but a bit comical situation, I was a bit happy. No doubt this had a darker side to it but after so many sleepless nights, thinking about food and women, I was more interested in theoney that it would bring.\n\nA rampage in the crowd signaled me. I made a dash for the stairs, the guards busy sorting the mess below. It took me a few minutes to find his body. I was surprised that it was still pretty much intact. Now to get it out of here. The windows would do the work.\n\nDown below I could hear the beating that James was recieving on his end. I though I must give that kid a bit more respect from now on.\n\nA folded paper in the body's pocket caught my eye.\n\n\"Dear son, sorry to keep you confused for so long. I was busy taking care of you mom. Would you join her...come meet me at our old residence. Even though you are my son, you are of no use to me now. - your father.\"\n\nI went to the balcony, singnaled a battered James to get the hell out, went back into the room, and jumped out of the window. I ran. Ran. Ran. Ran. Rain. Rain. Rain.\n\n3 Days later...\n\nA flower basket in my hand, I entered the makeshift hospital. There he was, propped against an old chair, barely alive.\n\n\"Talk about surprises!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Fuck You! You left me there to die.\" James uttered.\n\n\"I must admit kid, you can take a hellata beating.\"\n\n\"...fuck you...\"\n\nI had went to our clients house and as I had guessed, it was deserted. So, a man kills his son, hands him to some goons, hires a detective, disappears. Make sense.\n\nI lit another cigar. All that I know now is that my badge lies in some old dumpster and my gun in some old drawer. Life is easy when we don't have people telling us what to do. However, it is also a recipe for injury.\n", "Reject Job": "I went back in and after a few minutes go out .\n\n\"So?\" James asked.\n\n\"We dropped the case. Let us go.\"\n\n\"...hey what is that in your hand?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I mean seriously, what is that?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nI sold those organs a few days later. It didn't bring as much money as I had though. The process was not very smooth either. We spent the money in a couple of days. But then again, it is better to be broke than dead. God Bless Amurica!\n", "Return to the client": "Three days later, I was back in the shit hole I started with. The only difference was that it was even more wider than I had known. The bunglow flashed in the view.\n\n\"I guess we know what we are doing.\" James says, brandashing his .55.\n\n\"That gun's bust.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That gun is bust.\"\n\n\"Huh? I think you are just jealous.\"\n\n\"You bought it from the loan shark?\"\n\n\"If you me Grumpy Fella, then yes I did.\"\n\nI smiled. Kids.\n\n\"He told me this is the best shit in the market.\"\n\n\"I bet it is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was silent. I could see our client.\n\n\"There is that bastered.\" I murmured.\n\n\"How are we gonna do this?\"\n\n\"I think I had already told you.\"\n\n\"Told me? No wait. What you told me was suicide. I need better plans.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the plan.\"\n\n\"Shake hands with him, do in his house, blow his brains when no one is looking?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nAnd a plan it was. With our clients back turned againsts us while he admired some shit paintings, James pulled out his gun and pulled the trigger.\n\n\"What the fuck!?\" the client turned back. \"What happened to this guy.\" he said, pointing at James dead body. I shrugged.\n\n\"This.\"\n\nI looked at the poor kid. Such a waste. I could practically hear that loan shark's devilish laughter. With two bodies, a blasted gun, and some candy, I relaxed on the sofa and waited as the guard patiently ran in and surrounded me. I guess the plan wasn't that good after all.\n\n\"Shit happens.\"\n\nI lit another cigar and smiled.\n", "Don't": "\"Should we follow them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWe were back in our ransack. It stank here but still was better than that filthy bar. I rummaged through the pile of clothes and coins and counted 17$ in total.\n\n\"That should last us a few more days.\"\n\nThe food was horrible and the wine tasted like pee and mucus.\n\n\"I have had worse.\" I said.\n\n\"The wine's even older than you.\"\n\nThe rain poured on.\n\n\"What is the last thing that you remember about your family James?\"\n\n\"...emmm...I guess my mom became a prostitute and my man died of some virus. Said he tried to throw me off the balcony once. What about you?\"\n\n\"I remember shit.\"\n\n\"Come on! Don't back off!\"\n\n\"Well, my parents used to rape me.\"\n\n\"That is not so bad.\"\n\n\"With a 12 inch dildo...\"\n\nJames almost vomited on me.\n\n\"Did you get....emmm....STDs.\"\n\n\"You can't get STDs from a dildo.\"\n\n\"I know...whatever.\"\n\nIt was almost dawn when I heared a shrilled scream. I wake up to find James gawking at a dead body. Looks like the poor soul tripped and fell on the rod.\n\n\"What is this doing here?\"\n\n\"I don't know! I wake up after a happy dream and find this on my ass.\"\n\n\"Fella impaled himself damn hard.\"\n\nThe fact that I found a photo of me and a gun in his pocket was enough to label him as an assassin.\n\n\"Who would want to kill us?\"\n\n\"Is it me or you always say the obivious?\"\n\nAnother quick search of the body revealed three loactions of interest - a dock, a tunnel, a bar. Also, I came to know that the assassin was sent by my client.\n\n\"I guess revenge is a bitch.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\" I smiled.\n", "Check the places": "We found nothing at the three locations of interest. We returned to our clients residence and found it deserted. With no leads to follow, we dropped the case and went back to our old lives. James had said something very deep that day. I wish I had paid attention.\n\nIf I would ever recite what happended at the three places, I would recite them like this -\n\n\"...so here I am. With my dumb companion James and his cat. I have no idea why he brought that cat. Said it would help in the investigation. Help my ass.\n\nThe bar was pretty much empty. A shame though, the booze was quite good. James got drunk and started making a scene. I had to kill his cat to stop him. He was angry.\n\nThere was no soul at the dock either that is if you do not count the three mangled bodies. The sea air was good though. Made James happy.\n\nI do not want to talk about a tunnel. It was an ambush. A bunch of goons attacked us. I tried to fight. James too. We were going for a tag team finisher but a sledgehammer swing at the back of my head knocked me out. When I woke up they demanded who sent us. I only looked up and said \"Your mother.\"\n\nI think I was a bit rude. Since James was now nothing but a mess of bones and flesh, I thought I would cooperate. I told them everything about our client and they let us go. Or whatever was left of us.\"\n", "Take revenge": "Blowing our client to pieces in public was the best way to take revenge. Or so we had thought.\n\nThe plan was pefect. Follow his schedule, strap his car with a bomb, watch him die and wave with a smile. Only if the bomb wasn't bust.\n\nThere he was, shopping booze and enjoying in the car. We were hidden in bushes.\n\n\"Why didn't it blast?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I...I don't know. I think there is something wrong with thr combi---\"\n\n\"Well then go and fix it.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\nI picked him up and lunged him at the car.\n\nJames was finished in a few minutes. The kid has got skills.\n\n\"Now we wait.\"\n\nThere was a satisfying blast. I lit a cigar and started walking towards my car.\n\n\"Shouldn't we check?\"\n\n\"Check what?\"\n\n\"If he is dead or...not.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"You know...like a double tap.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nHuh. Kids. I looked over my shoulders at the burning metal once more and got in.\n\nI wish I hadn't.\n\nThat day I learned a lesson. Never underestimate your enemies.

A jaunty tune of flutes and drums fills the cramped, smoky space that you force your way through. The bartender blinks one of its many black eyes and states in broken English that it doesn't serve your \"kind\".\n", "You head towards the security office": "As you enter the security office, you notice a few patrol bots and almost no other humans except for the one locked in a cell. The lack of security presence in such a rundown city makes you nervous as you approach the front desk. A patrol bot raises its head from its mindless scribbling as . . .\n", "You ask if they know someone by the name \"Kali-72\"": "The bot asks for identification first.\n", "You show them the delivery note": "The bot scans the signature on the note and confirms its authenticity.

A steady white haze begins to fill the empty streets as you walk steadily down the sidewalk. A busted streetlamp flickers up ahead, its yellow glow flashing occasionally through the fog. You check the address once more before strolling up to a crooked metal shack at the end of the street. As you approach the door, you pull out the package and grip it firmly in your anticipating palms.\nBut a twinge of curiosity suddenly hits you; what could be so important that it requires such a discreet delivery?\n", "You open the package": "You open the package and peer inside. Your eyes grow wide as a pitch black shadow reaches out and enshrouds you into a dark void of nothingness. You open your mouth to scream but no sound comes out. Your mind is racing, confused by the growing shadow that stretches over your paralyzed body and begins to swallow you whole. The lights of the street begin to dim as your vision grows hazy.

A few seconds later, the door swings wide open and you are immediately blinded by a flash of white light. You shield your eyes but the light persists to glow brighter and brighter until the light is nearly unbearable to face. You squeeze your eyes shut.\nSomeone yanks the helmet off of your head. You jerk upright in the chair, sweat running from the imprints of where the helmet's foam lining pressed against your skin.

You climb out of the ship and start for the building.  You're hurt from the bad landing but not enough to stay cooped up in that ship.  Inside it is a tiny restaurant.  Lots of aliens are eating in booths and at tables.  You're hungry but you need help and information too.\n", "Sit at a booth and wait for server": "You take a seat at a booth ('cause they're so much cooler than tables).  A server eventually comes to your table.\n\n\"Are ya' ready tuh order?\" he asks.  You glance down at the menu.  Most of the foods are fancy dishes written in an alien language.

You rot poor, old, and alone.\n", "Go to the shop and ask for help repairing your ship": "You mosie over to the shop.  Getting off this crater is the best idea right now.  As you walk inside, you see more ships than you've ever seen in your life.  'Course, they're all busted.  Except one that's completely fixed up.  Looks like a XC-89 model, too, the best around.

He tells you the ship can be prepared, but it will cost 300 Space Coins (that's the same as a million American dollars).  You don't think it's a good idea to pay practically all your money for your ship, but you  have to get out of here!  So, you pay him the money up front.  He goes out with a few workers.  The XC-89's just staring you down right now.\n", "Wait for Dick": "You wait for him and when he comes back he tells you he can't fix the ship.  But the sleaze refuses to admit to anyone that you paid him!  Now you're stiffed 300 Space Coins and no ship!\n", "Run to the XC-89": "The sooner out of here the better.  When no one's looking you make a daring leap for the ship.  You climb aboard, go straight to the control room and start fiddling with the controls.\n", "It doesn't start": "You try to start it up repeatedly but it doesn't work.  Then you remember: when they fix a ship, the repair companies always put the engine in last so the owner doesn't fly off without paying!  The workers board the ship and take you away.  You're placed in the cooler (that's hip talk for jail) where you rot.\n\n \n", "Get the Goody Burger": "It may have a lame name but burgers are your favorite food.  When you order he laughs out loud.\n\n\"Hey, Bill!  Dis guy's orderin' off da kid menu!\" he yells.  Arrghh!  Total embarrassment!  Now everyone's laughing at you.  Of course with a name like Goody Burger it's bound to have come off the kid menu.\n", "Stick up for yourself": "This character is soiling your good name!  He doesn't look so tough.  Surely you can take him.\n\n\"I wouldn't talk, pipsqueak.\" you say as you stand up.  You get ready to say a great comeback but then you realize the horrifying truth: this guy's big.  He can probably beat you to a pulp.  And after that remark, you wouldn't be surprised if he did.\n\n\"No body talks tuh Sam dat way!\" he says.  He grabs your neck and throws you on top of the table.  You figure your back is broken.  He beats you pretty good.  So good, you don't make it out of this beating alive.\n", "Slink into your seat and die of embarrassment": "What an ordeal!  You just slink into your seat and wait for the laughter to die down.  It does but you can tell everyone's looking at you and snickering.  The server comes back with your Goody Burger and-that jerk!-a bib.  The laughter gets loud again as he wraps it around your neck.  Oh, joy.  You bite into your burger but the taste is drained out by the humiliation.  You're beginning to hate this guy.  As you eat, some guy comes and sits across from you.  He's not some strange alien being.  He's human, like you.  His hair's sticking up all over, oil stains cover his face, he has piercings every wear.  He's human all right but certainly not normal.\n\n\"I'm Dick.\" he says, extending a greasy hand, \"I own Dick's Ship Repair.\"  Hoo yeah!  This guy can repair your ship!  You shake his hand happily.\n", "Ask about repairing your ship": "Who cares why he came over, he can fix your ship!\n\n\"I suppose, but I'm gonna need to make sure you can pay.\" he says.  You ask how much it'll take to fix up the ship.\n\n\"Dunno.  Gotta see it.\"\n", "Say forget it": "You tell him to forget it.  You probably don't have enough money anyway.  So now you're stuck here.\n", "Take him to see it": "You take him out to see it.\n\n\"Ouch.  Buddy, you banged it up pretty well.\" he says.  He walks around the ship, surveying every detail.\n\n\"If I can fix it, it'll be 300 Space Coins.\"(you may not know, but 300 Space Coins is the same as a million American dollars)\n", "\"What?! Forget it, you con-artist!\"": "He doesn't like being called that.  He takes out an Ifra-red blaster and aims straight for you.  Gulp.  After he pulls the trigger, you wish you had just payed up.\n", "\"Sorry, I just don't have enough.\"": "He's upset.  He stalks off and you're left with no way out.\n", "Say okay and pay up": "You give him the cash and he calls a few of his working buddies.  In a few days, it's fixed up and you get out of the dump!\n", "Ask why he came over": "He looks at you slyly.\n\n\"I wanna make a deal.\" he says.  He glances around, then lowers his head.\n\n\"You work for IPP, don't you?\" (in case you weren't paying attention, in the beginning it says you work at the Intergalactic Protection Program.  IPP.  OK?)  You're surprised he knows this.  Of course, you ask how he knew.\n\n\"Well, no one other than an IPP guy wears a snazzy space suit like that.\"  Of course, you think to yourself.\n\n\"Anyway, I hear IPP guys make a lot of dough, I'm I right?\"  He's right.\n\n\"So, if I fix up your ship, you can get me off this rock.  I mean, I can't fix ships all my life, can I?\"\n\nIt's a tempting offer, but he's a strange character.\n", "Show him your ship": "You have to get out of here and he's the guy to do it.  You show it to him.\n\n\"Not to bad.  Help me push it out.\" he says.  You go to starboard and push, push, push and-plop!-it comes out with only a few scratches.  As you start to run inside, Dick holds you back a second and says, \"Whoa!  Stay back a sec, bud.  Gotta check the inside.\"  He goes in and starts it up.  Wait, he's flying off without you!  You run to catch up but he's high in the air now.\n\n\"Sucker!\" he spats as he swores.  You knew he was a shady character!  Oh, well.  Now you're stuck here forever.\n", "Tell him to beat it": "You can't trust him.  You tell him to beat it.\n\n\"Oh yeah?!\" he yells, standing up now.\n\n\"Yeah!\" you yell back, standing too.  He yanks an Infra-red blaster out and-BRZAP!-your toast.

Its lack of markings tells you that it isn\u2019t a cop, and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to puzzle out the rest.

Exactly three seconds after you take the motorcycle into the market, the first stall explodes in a rain of high-calibre death. The shopkeeper and her chickens are reduced to a fine red mist. Instantly, the market explodes into a furor. \n\n\nA fat, aged, Chinese man reaches under his stall and produces a black market mag-grenade launcher. \u201cYou fucking Tong mothafucka not happy with money I already pay?\u201d he demands indignantly, before firing a barrage of sticky grenades at the drone. \n\n\nYou laugh as you drive away, leaving death and chaos in your wake.\n\n\n \n", "HEAD TO THE DOCKS": "You lay low for a few hours. You buy a few loosies and slum it  in a covered back alley, smoking and shooting the shit as best you can. As day turns to night, the usual suspects emerge; whores, junkies, fixers and punks. These people are high-tech lowlives, vermin that twist, scream, and fuck in the neon-drenched streets. \n\n\nYou\u2019re close enough to the docks now that you no longer need the motorcycle. You toss the keys to the first bum you see.

You reach into your jacket pocket and feel the cold weight of the revolver. It comforts you. \n\n\nYou pass a sign that says Al-Kobe Port, which makes you figure you\u2019re on the right track. You quickly walk a few more blocks. The no-question motels and cheap shredclinics that cater to sailors act as even further confirmation. Soon, you come across rows of dockside warehouses, and the port comes into view. It\u2019s a minor port, and its fortunes have diminished even further as a result of the recent epidemic of octo-piracy in the Pacific. That means no security robots, just a few night watchmen who you duck with ease. \n\n\nSoon, you arrive at Warehouse  K2-29-139.  You\u2019re in the right place at the right time. You open the door. \n", "SHOWDOWN AT THE WHARF": "You enter the warehouse. Half of it is open to the water, probably to facilitate clandestine unloading.

There\u2019s a conspicuous wooden crate right by the waterfront. \n\n\n\u201cSergei?\u201d you call out uncertainly. You take your gun out and hide it behind your back. Your thumb finds the hammer and cocks it. \n\n\nYou nervously step back as something rises out of the water. One reddish, puckered tentacle, then another, then another. \n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were a fuckin octopus!\u201d you hiss. \n\n\nSergei shrugs with all eight of his tentacles. \n\n\nHis limbs begin to twist and contort in ASL - Animal Sign Language. \n\n\nEasiest way to get package back.

I\u2019m not doing shit \u2018til I have my ride out of here,\u201d \n\n\nSergei reaches behind him. Instinctively, you throw yourself to the ground. You look behind you as you do, and notice the ninja star quivering in the wall behind you. It would have gone right through your throat. Sergei smashes the crate, and you can hear the whine of a plasma gun. You roll to the side as he vaporizes the ground you were laying on a split second before. \n\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d you yell, putting the briefcase in front of you. \u201cIf you kill me, you destroy this!\u201d \n\n\nHe points the gun into the air with one tentacle, and begins to sign with the rest. \n\n\n\u201cHands on the floor motherfuckers!\u201d comes a booming voice from behind you. You step to the side, and point your gun at the source of it. A bald white guy with shades, an immaculate suit, and two laser pistols bursts into the room. He trains his guns on you and Sergei; Sergei trains his gun on him, and you train your gun on Sergei. \n\n\n\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d you ask. \n\n\n\u201cHarris Smith, Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d he says. The chimps from earlier follow behind him, training their guns on you and the Soviet octopus. The two laser sights trained on your chest make you understandably nervous. You hold the briefcase in front of you like a protective shield. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a good run, Mohammed James Wang, if that\u2019s even your real name. But it\u2019s time to give it up. Nobody robs Uncle Sam and gets away with it. What\u2019s in that thing, anyway?\u201d \n\n\nHe poses a fair question.

Glory to the People\u2019s Octopode Republic!\u201d You fire three shots into the briefcase. It glows white hot for a brief second. The chimps gun you down a millisecond after, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The briefcase goes thermonuclear. The ensuing fireball kills the chimps, Sergei, Smith, and everyone else in the city. It triggers an earthquake and a tsunami, killing tens of thousands. \n\n\nIn the after-action report, both the CIA and the FSB realize they\u2019ve made a crucial mistake. While both suspected that Mohamed James Wang was a fake name, they both assumed you were a human being; this proved to be a critical error. Mohamed James Wang was the pseudonym of Tiberius Erik III, an uplifted octopus and notorious octopode-rights terrorist; he had been strategically inserted into a human body a few months before.\n\n\n \n\nYOU HAVE STRUCK A GLORIOUS BLOW FOR CEPHALOPODS EVERYWHERE. \n", "NOTHING": "\u201cLampshade. Wall. Four. Green. Sixty-two,\u201d you say matter-of-factly. \n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Smith snaps. \n\n\nThe chimps shudder as you speak their hypnotic activation code. They thought they were hunting you, but they had it all wrong. That was just a hypnotically-implanted cover story, to cover up Operation Rattrap: the years-long program you have been running to sniff out moles in the Agency. \n\n\nYou throw yourself on the ground and put six rounds into Sergei before he can respond. His plasma fire goes wild, blowing white-hot holes in the ceiling as he sinks into the ocean. As the chimps zip-tie him, you walk up to Smith. \n\n\n\u201cSmith, you stupid fuck. You don\u2019t think I know you\u2019ve been selling secrets to the Chinese the whole time?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHey c\u2019mon pal, we can make this work. What\u2019s say we all take this briefcase and sell it, and live off the proceeds? Fellas?\u201d \n\n\nYou laugh as you open the briefcase and slide it over to him with your foot. As he looks inside, you laugh. There\u2019s nothing in the briefcase. There was never anything in the briefcase. \n\n\n\u201cBook him, boys.\u201d \n\n\n \n\nYOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY UNCOVERED A MOLE IN THE AGENCY. \n", "LEAP FROM THE MOTORCYCLE AND DUCK FOR COVER": "You slam the breaks and leap off, as best you can. Sometime between you slamming the brakes and your meeting with the pavement, you realize you\u2019ve made a mistake. You bounce off the concrete, shattering every bone in your body. As you lay there, broken, the drone slows down and hovers over to you. \n\n\nIt hangs in the air, almost mockingly. You groan as life leaves your body. Not fast enough for the spooks, however, as it blasts you until all that remains is a red-stained crater in the concrete. \n", "SELL IT TO THE YAKUZA": "You\u2019ve got a buyer lined up. You\u2019re selling the briefcase to the Fukuhara Clan, the yakuza syndicate that runs illicit goods on and off the island. As the apes go through your apartment, you grab a motorcyclist and hurl him off his bike and into the street. \n\n\n\u201cHey, fuck you, man!\u201d he yells indignantly. \n\n\nYou point your gun in his face to discourage heroism and get on the bike. The engine sputters momentarily, and you curse the Indonesian, cheap-ass, piece of shit engine before it purrs in agreement and you take off down the street. \n\n\nYou duck as a chimp fires a beam of scorching white light from the window. It hits a car behind you. The heat transfers through the car almost instantly, igniting the fuel, melting the tires, and leaving a fist sized hole in the driver's side door. As you drive away it explodes, sending deadly shrapnel flying through the air. If the spooks are willing to fire plasma beams in a major urban centre, they must really want you dead. \n\n\nYou drive to the Laughing Buddha Bathhouse, a known hangout for the criminal syndicate. You know the owner of the Laughing Buddha, Eiko Fukuhara, is an infamous son-of-a-bitch, known for his short temper and brutality. It\u2019s expected that the clan will fall apart when he inherits from the old man. As you pull up in front of Laughing Buddha, your fingers close around the revolver in your pocket. \n", "ENTER THE BATHHOUSE": "You walk in through the dilapidated facade, eager to get off the street and away from prying eyes. Inside is a nondescript waiting room with a few tattered pleather chairs, an old school, arcade-style ticket machine, and a bored doorman. There\u2019s nothing on the walls save for a calendar of Shinto holidays that\u2019s a few years out of date, and two Rocky Balboa posters. You approach the doorman. \n\n\n\u201cYou pay, you take a ticket,\u201d he says disinterestedly. He\u2019s a paunchy old Japanese man who doesn\u2019t strike you as much of a threat. \n\n\nYou pay, and you take a ticket. You step out of the waiting room, walk down brusquely down a hallway, before arriving at the men\u2019s change room. You seem to remember that the fashion for the Japanese bathhouse involves being naked. While you\u2019re certainly not going to part with the briefcase, you wonder if being polite wouldn\u2019t endear you better to the Yakuza boss\u2019s son. If things go sour, however, you\u2019ll probably want your gun. \n", "ENTER NAKED": "You strip down completely nude, and store your clothing in a locker. You tuck your gun in your jacket pocket, and then drape the sleeve over the handle for good measure. You close the locker and grab the briefcase, before exiting the hallway. As you enter the public bath, you\u2019re shocked by how pleasant it is. \n\n\nThe bath itself is spacious and steaming, occupying the centre of the room. A dozen heavily tattooed Japanese men lounge nude in the water, leaning on their elbows and idly chattering. The walls, although dingy, are covered in a bamboo facade. Lamps on the ceiling imitate sunlight, and piped-in birdsong plays faintly. An old pair of nunchaku hang from one of the walls. \n\n\nAs you step foot in the bath, every head turns to you. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Eiko Fukunara,\u201d you say. Your grip tightens on the briefcase. \n\n\nA wiry, lean-muscled man with immaculate hair stands. \u201cI\u2019m Eiko,\u201d he says. He has one of those faces that seems to constantly sneer. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the briefcase for your father. I was supposed to meet you here,\u201d you say.  You nervously grind the ball of your foot into the floor. \n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing is, my father and I have had a falling out.\u201d \n\n\nYou narrow your eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd delivering him that briefcase, free of charge, is just the thing I need to get back in his good graces.\u201d Silence hangs in the air for a moment. \n\n\nYou place the briefcase on the ground and slide it backwards with your foot. You crack your knuckles and stand lightly on the balls of your feet. \n\n\n\u201cKill him, and bring me the briefcase,\u201d Eiko says. \n", "NAKED BRAWL WITH YAKUZA GOONS": "They scream. You scream. The first yakuza soldier is on you in seconds. You duck beneath his haymaker and deliver a savage punch to his windpipe. He staggers, clutching at his neck. You dodge a punch from the side and trap the arm to your chest. You throw the second attacker into the third, and they both go tumbling into the bath. \n\n\nYou fight like a cornered tiger. As you leap to the ground to avoid a flurry of blows, you sweep a man\u2019s leg and bring him to the floor. You lock eyes with him for the briefest of instants, just long enough to see the fear in his eyes. You grab his head and smash it against the concrete with such ferocity that blood sprays out in a thin geyser. His comrades back off. \n\n\nAlready, you\u2019re feeling winded. As the yakuza soldiers regain their courage, your mind races for an equalizer. The gun is too far, but the nunchaku are not. As you grab it from the wall, you execute a flawless nunchaku kata. For a moment, the naked criminals seem to weigh their loyalty against their boss with their fear of the whirling doom that stands before them. \n\n\nAs they charge, you crack the first man\u2019s skull open like a coconut.  You swing your shin into someone\u2019s knee and watch it bulge in the wrong direction. As he cries in agony, you step back to avoid a savage punch from one of the gangsters. Your new assailant slips on the blood of his comrades, and you strike him in the jaw with the nunchaku. As he staggers away, clutching his mouth, you roundhouse kick his jaw with such strength that his teeth scatter like jacks in a children\u2019s game. \n\n\nOnce again, the violence of your attack leaves them stunned. A layer of blood now sits atop the steaming waters of the bath. You redouble your attacks. You hack and bludgeon, kick and punch, dodge and counter, over and over, screaming a gutteral war-cry the entire time. When your assault is finished, you stand atop a bloody pile of dead and crippled gangsters. Eiko tries to flee, but you hurl the nunchaku into his ankles. He falls to the ground, breaking his nose against the tiles. \n\n\nYou grab him by the hair and drag him to the edge of the water.\n\n\n\u201cW-wh-who the fuck are you?\u201d he squeals. \n\n\n\u201cNever you mind,\u201d you say. \u201cWhere is your old man hiding?\u201d \n", "THE OLD MAN": "When Old Man Fukuhara enters his office, he finds you sitting at his desk. You\u2019re drinking his sake, and seated in his comfortable leather chair. \n\n\nHis bodyguard, a lab-grown slab of muscle, immediately extends his arm-mounted monomolecular blades. Fukuhara waves him down. As he sits in the other chair, you get a good long look at him. He must be seventy five, but still carries himself with a poise and strength uncommon in the elderly. He built this empire himself, you muse to yourself. He must have been formidable. \n\n\nHe chuckles as you pour him a shot of sake. \u201cYour impudence is impressive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have to wonder, how did you get in here?\u201d \n\n\nYou wave a hand in mock dismissal. \u201cAll in good time, Fukuhara-sama.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLet me kill this man,\u201d his bodyguard says. His expression is neutral, but you can see the rage burning in his cybernetic eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI will hear what he has to say,\u201d Fukuhara says. \n\n\n\u201cI contacted you some time about the briefcase,\u201d you say. \n\n\n\u201cIndeed. You did not tell me what was in it, but our\u2026 ah, what is the word. Net-runners picked up considerable chatter about it. It is an object of great value, is it not?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d you say. You place the briefcase on the desk. As he unbuckles it, your muscles tense. As the old man opens the briefcase, he gasps in horror. In the same instant, you unsheath the shuriken from your thigh and hurl it into the bodyguard\u2019s throat. He stumbles out of the room, gurgling and clutching at his throat. \n\n\n\u201cYou like what you see?\u201d you say over the old man\u2019s weeping and gagging. As you walk around the desk, you admire your handiwork. Eiko\u2019s head, delivered in a briefcase. A fitting gift. \u201cI must say, pretending to be a foreigner was degrading. And the plastic surgery was agony.  Living as street-scum, even more so. It was expensive, hiring a netrunner to fake the darknet chatter around the briefcase, make it look like something valuable. But it was worth it.\u201d \n\n\nHe manages to get a coherent word out: \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\nYou gingerly take the sheathed katana from off the wall. As you draw it, you admire the blade\u2019s marvelous balancing and fine craftsmanship. \u201cYou slaughtered my village. I\u2019ve been training for this moment for twenty years. And you didn\u2019t even know who I was.\u201d You smile grimly. \n\n\nHe opens his mouth, as if to speak, but you don\u2019t give him the chance. You behead the old man in one smooth motion. His head topples into the opened briefcase, where it rests alongside Eiko\u2019s.  Father and son. \n\n\n \n\nYOU HAVE CUT THE HEAD FROM THE YAKUZA SERPENT AND RESTORED YOUR HONOUR.\n", "ENTER FULLY-CLOTHED": "You enter fully clothed. As it turns out, your breach of bathhouse etiquette does not matter in the least. The owner is dead, as are all his men. \n\n\nYou step into the bathhouse. You get the sense it was quite lovely, considering the modest fee you paid to enter. The walls are covered in a bamboo facade, the bath is steaming, and there are soft mats on the floor to prevent tripping. The bath is quite spacious. Recorded birdsong is still playing. \n\n\nYou instantly realize that you have walked in on a gangland hit. \n\n\nThe assassin doesn\u2019t notice you, at first. Her back is turned to the door as she deals with the last yakuza bodyguard. He produces a pistol from under one of the mats, but hits only air. She vanishes like a ghost, before reappearing behind him. You watch in fascination as she cleanly beheads him with a length of mono-molecular wire anchored to a false thumb. As his head falls into the pool, she notices you. She\u2019s white, with a shaved head and covered in tattoos that look like some kind of alphanumeric code. She wears a black skinsuit, and one of her eyes has been replaced with a round, lens-like cybernetic upgrade. As it whirs and clicks, you can already tell that she\u2019s done a full body-scan of your augmentations and whatever weapons you might be carrying. \n\n\n\u201cWhatever deal you have is probably off,\u201d she says with remarkable good humour as she flicks the blood off the wire. It snakes back into her thumb, which snaps shut like a zippo lighter. \n\n\n\u201cYeah, looks that way,\u201d you say. \n\n\n\u201cI saw what\u2019s in that briefcase,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen I scanned you.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be carrying that.

You watch her footprints on the tiles: three immaculate boot-prints in the blood and bathwater, before vanishing completely.

It was 2 am and I wanted to sleep; but the Coolice had worn off, so I just stared at all the colors from the neon signs outside in the city. The cybernetics made sure that hardly anyone slept any more without Coolice, but these days it was a little harder to get. It had been outlawed for a decade, but that didn\u2019t matter to anyone. Once you tried Coolice, you didn\u2019t sleep much without it. I thought about getting up to head outside to try and find more. My regular suppliers were out, but I was sure I could find more if I wanted to work at it.\n\nSuddenly the door to my tiny apartment flew open. I sat up and saw a skinny woman crashing through the door. She was dressed in the usual \u2013 short black leather skirt and a bright pink pvc halter top. It looked like her pink hair had been shaved in the past, but she was due for a haircut, it was getting longer and uneven. She had long gloves on her hands that looked like they might have once been white but were mostly dark grey now.\n\nShe slammed the door behind her and said, \u201cYou have got to help me! They\u2019re after me!\u201d\n\nI shrugged. Someone was always after someone in this place. I checked her body out as she ran over and looked out the window. This was one of the so-called modern apartments, so the entire wall was a window. I watched as the neon lights glimmered off her tight, sweaty body. She jumped back from the window as a searchlight flashed past.\n\nI said, \u201cYeah. Who\u2019s after you?\u201d\n\nShe turned and looked at me and said, \u201cPlease help me. They think I\u2019ve got some chip, but I don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah. Some chip.\u201d It seemed like at least once a month there was some computer chip that was the center of some controversy these days. It was usually the government losing one or someone else creating one that the government wanted. And when the government got it, they often lost it, anyway. I continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to do about it.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cDamn you! Would you just help me?\u201d She leaned forward as if she was trying to give me a view of her chest, but she didn\u2019t have all that much there, and the halter top didn\u2019t move, so I really didn\u2019t see anything. I looked, anyway.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything but trying to sleep, so why not? Do you know who is after you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is. I just know it\u2019s a bunch of Asian-looking guys. Nearly all of them were short, but there were more than a few that were pretty big, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nThat got my attention. I stood up from the bed and said, \u201cYou mean the Azakas?\u201d\n\n\u201cAza-whats?\u201d She peeked out the window again and said, \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know who the hell they are, just that they\u2019re after me. I told them I didn\u2019t have any chip, but they didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201d\n\nI got up and headed over to the door and listened. I said, \u201cKaren, I don\u2019t know what the hell you did to piss them off, but why did you have to bring me into it?\u201d\n\nShe stood up and said, \u201cKaren? I\u2019m no Karen, you asshole. My damn name is Loor.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t hear anything at the door and said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn. If you\u2019ve led the Azakas here, we\u2019re both dead. There isn\u2019t any back way out of these tiny apartments! And why the hell did you pick mine to bust into in the middle of the night?\u201d\n\nShe put her hands on her face and started crying. She mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone. I don\u2019t know where to go. Those Asian guys are going to do something to me, I don\u2019t know what.\u201d\n\nLike the sucker I am, I walked over to her and patted her on her back, saying, \u201cThere, there.\u201d\n\nShe lowered her hands and said, \u201cPlease. Please help me.\u201d\n\nAt this point I figured I was screwed, anyway. If the Azakas followed her here, they wouldn\u2019t care that I didn\u2019t know her, they\u2019d rub me out without a thought. I said, \u201cFine, sure. Let\u2019s go, but be quiet, those Azakas have spies and trackers all ove the place.\u201d\n\nI grabbed her hand and pulled her to the door. I listened again and hear nothing. I opened the door and peeked out. I didn\u2019t see anyone along the hallway in either direction. I pulled her out the door and took a left. I knew there was an old, hidden stairway down that hall, but I hadn\u2019t seen it in a long time. I hoped I could still get to it, or I\u2019d be running into another dead end.\n\nWe ran down the hallway and to the corner. I pushed her into an alcove at the corner that didn\u2019t appear to have any purpose. I crammed myself in with her, pressing our bodies together tightly. She didn\u2019t appear to mind. I whispered, \u201cQuiet now.\u201d I listened carefully to see if I could hear anyone coming. I thought I could hear footsteps from the long hallway. I said, \u201cAre they tracking you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n", "Engaging the Old Elevator": "I reached out and slid my finger along the top of the doorframe. It took me a moment to find it, but then I found the latch. I opened the latch and reached into the hidden compartment. I have no idea why it was there or who would have put it there. I would have thought whoever rebuilt these modern apartments would have just covered up the old elevator, because that would be easier than actually building anything useful. But someone had left the latch, the compartment, and the button. I pressed the button.\n\nThe small alcove lurched, and Loor\u2019s body slid up against mine. We were pushed together as the small elevator started to move. Unfortunately, I could hear the grinding of the old chains and gears as the elevator moved. And if I could hear them, so could anyone else. There was nothing else that could be done now. The elevator was an uneven ride, stopping and starting as gears slipped. The space was not large enough for two people, but we managed. I don\u2019t know how Loor managed to keep that halter top in place during the ride. There was another bump and suddenly we were at the bottom of the elevator shaft.\n\nI turned and pushed my way out to the basement hallway. I grabbed Loor\u2019s hand and pulled her out of the small alcove. The basement was old and abandoned. The concrete walls were grey where they were not covered with black mold. I tried not to touch the walls as we ran down the hall and around the corner. It had been a long time since I had been in these tunnels, but I knew the way out. A few more turns and we reached a short stairway that ended in a flat ceiling.\n\nI let go of her hand and said, \u201cWait here a moment. This is a way out. Let me get up there, open the doors, and check the alley. If it\u2019s clear, I\u2019ll come back and get you.\u201d\n\nLoor said, \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t come back because I\u2019ll probably be dead, right?\u201d\n\nShe grabbed me and pulled me close, then kissed me. She said, \u201cCome back.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why she did that, but I\u2019ve never understood women. I worked my way up the short stairway and found the four catches that were holding the large door closed. Each of the squealed as if in pain from the rust and having not been moved in a long time. I had to push hard to get the door to open \u2013 not only was I pushing up, against gravity, but those hinges had not moved in years, either. The metal door eventually opened all the way and I slipped out. I turned back and gently set the door back down. I\u2019m not sure there was any point in trying to be quiet at this time, but there really wasn\u2019t any need to slam the door.\n\nThe door was near the end of an alley. The alley was dark and wet. I could see reflections of the neon signs from the main street in the puddles that were not filled with trash. There was one guy lying in one of the puddles, staring out into space. He didn\u2019t even notice me. I slipped past him and looked around the corner.\n\nBeyond the corner, walking down the alley towards me was a group of six short guys. I could see what she meant about the size of them. It looked like the Azakas had brought plenty of muscle, just in case. I guessed they were artificial, but it didn\u2019t matter at this point. I quickly headed back down the alley and looked for somewhere to hide. There was nowhere to hide. I tried to hide behind the entrance door to the basement, but there really wasn\u2019t any space there. The group came around the corner.\n\nOne pointed and said, \u201cThere.\u201d He looked down at a device in his hand and continued, \u201cShe is in that door.\u201d Then he pointed to me and said, \u201cEliminate that.\u201d\n\nThe two that were not the muscle aimed their guns at me and lasers flew out at me.\n", "Searching for a Tracker": "I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d I stepped back out of the alcove, looking her up and down and said, \u201cIf they are this far behind you, they must be tracking you.\u201d I looked over the little bit of clothes she had on and said, \u201cYou must have a tracker on you somewhere.\u201d\n\nShe ran her hands over the outside of her clothes, somehow despite the circumstances, in a seductive manner. She looked up at me and said, \u201cSee? Nothing?\u201d I could see, but I couldn\u2019t see a tracker.\n\nI said, \u201cAre these your clothes? Did they have access to them?\u201d\n\nShe looked insulted as she said, \u201cWhat do I look like to you?\u201d I knew better than to answer that question. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I reached out and grabbed the edge of her top, running my fingers along the seam. I didn\u2019t feel anything. I spun her around and checked out the back side of the top as well. Still nothing.\n\nI turned her back around and said, \u201cWhat about piercings? Do you have any?\u201d\n\nShe stuck her tongue out and showed me a stud there. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only one?\u201d She nodded. I said, \u201cHave you taken it out or left it lying around anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It just stays there.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t have their chip? If you do, that\u2019s what they could be tracking.\u201d\n\nShe paused before she answered, and I knew what that meant. I said, \u201cYou bitch! You lied to me already. They\u2019re after you because you stole their chip, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nShe looked like she was about to start crying again. She said, \u201cYes, I took it. I had to. I need the tokens. I\u2019m going to sell it to a crytpo guy.\u201d\n\nI looked around and said, \u201cDamn. I know where we can shut down the tracker, let\u2019s go.\u201d I started towards the back stairway, but stopped when I could hear footsteps in that direction. I said, \u201cToo late. We can\u2019t go that way. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get away from that tracker.\u201d I looked around then grabbed her hand and said, \u201cCome on!\u201d\n\nI pulled her along to the main stairway. I could hear footsteps, but they sounded like they were coming closer, so they were likely on the up staircase. If they had a tracker on her, that wouldn\u2019t matter, they\u2019d see us passing them and wipe us out on the spot. I ran back into the hallway and towards the end with the window.\n\nWe reached the window and I yanked it open. We were on the tenth floor, so no way could we jump from here, at least not without some serious cyber alterations. I climbed out the window and she stopped, looking at me like I was crazy. I said, \u201cCome on! There\u2019s an old fire escape out here. We might be able to get away for a little while, long enough to find a neutralizer for that damn tracker!\u201d\n\nI pulled her out the window and onto the fire escape. It had been built a long time ago, and those weren\u2019t part of buildings anymore, so it was shaky. There were places where bolts had disconnected from the building, so the entire structure groaned and creaked as we walked along the catwalk. We reached the end of the building and found stairs going both up and down.\n\nLoor pointed down and said, \u201cI think I see some of them, down there on the ground, at the bottom of these stairs and ladders.\u201d\n", "Heading Up": "I looked down and could see two rather large guys standing below the fire escape. They weren\u2019t looking up, probably because of the rain that was making all of the fire escape slippery. That didn\u2019t matter to me, I just started up the stairs towards the roof. I didn\u2019t know what I expected to find there, but I didn\u2019t see any other way to go. I looked back at Loor and wondered why I was getting involved.\n\nI headed up the stairs. It was another twenty-plus flights of stairs to the roof. With the slippery steps and the swaying framework, there was no need to rush. I carefully worked my way up one flight of stairs after the other. After about five flights I turned the corner and started up the next flight, but there was a creak and groan from the stairs!\n\nA section of the stairs going up started to separate a little more from the wall. The metal shrieked as it shifted with the sudden weight of me and Loor on it. We were already too high up to do anything else \u2013 if this thing fell, we were going to hit the ground hard. I took the only chance we had, grabbed Loor\u2019s hand again, and ran up the swaying metal staircase.\n\nThe stairs turned in the wind and Loor\u2019s foot slipped on the slippery metal steps. Her hand was yanked from mine as she went to her knees. I turned back and watched as the brick wall appeared to move away from us. Running down the stairs, I grabbed her by the waist and was surprised at how light she was. I half-pulled and half-dragged her up the next flight of stairs. We managed to make the next landing just as the metal twisted and completely pulled away from the wall.\n\nWe landed on our rear on the metal landing. We looked down and watched as one story, then another pulled from the wall. As more metal moved, the process accelerated. Far below we could see the men there look up and point, then run down the alley, trying to escape the falling metal debris. I looked over to see that Loor\u2019s short skirt had slid up a bit. She noticed me looking and smiled, not moving.\n\nI got back to my feet and helped her up as well. The sound of the crash of metal was far away. I checked out the steps going up and they looked more solid. As we continued up the stairs, the rain and wind started to pick up. It wasn\u2019t going to knock us off, there were solid railings most of the way up, but it wasn\u2019t making walking any easier. I tried to remember why I agreed to help this girl.\n\nWhen we reached the last landing, I could see the flaw in my plan: the old fire escape didn\u2019t go all the way to the roof. The last time I had been out here was a long time ago and I could see there were the remains of a tattered ladder hanging from the roof just above the end of the platform. I looked over to Loor.\n\n\u201cLook, this last little bit is going to be hard. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not a fattie, or this wouldn\u2019t even be happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was a fattie, I don\u2019t think this stairway would have held me at all.\u201d\n\nI smiled and pointed up at the tattered remains of a ladder, \u201cI\u2019m going to jump up there and grab that\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore I could continue, she interrupted, \u201cPlease, you can\u2019t leave me here.\u201d She reached her arms out and grabbed me around the waist, holding on tightly. I tried to push her away, but she would not let go.\n\nI said, \u201cEasy now. I\u2019m not going to leave you. Let me finish.\u201d She did not let go, but I continued, \u201cOnce I\u2019ve got ahold of the ladder, you grab onto me. Then you can either climb up, or I\u2019ll just pull us both up.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \u201cOh, I can grab onto you.\u201d\n\nWhen she did, she loosened her grip a little and I managed to free myself from her clutches. I looked down at her and said, \u201cYou understand, right? Wait for me to grab hold first.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. I stepped over to the end of the platform. Without looking down, I jumped straight up and grabbed the lowest rung on the ladder. The rung was wet and I was adjusting my grip when I felt the added weight of Loor slam into my back. I grunted, but I held on. At this point I could tell that she wasn\u2019t going to climb up herself. I flexed my shoulders and arms and managed to reach up to the next rung. It took nearly all my strength and my shoulders were burning as I reached up again and again to pull the two of us up the ladder. It was a relief when I managed to get my feet under me and onto the bottom rung. I moved quickly in case Loor lost her grip, but she didn\u2019t seem to have any problems holding on. I pulled us both over the edge of the roof and we tumbled onto the rough tar paper roof, rain falling all around us. I rolled through a puddle as Loor spun and landed on top of me.\n\nShe pushed herself up with her arms and looked down at me. The rain fell onto her head and dripped across her cheeks. She stared into my eyes. Over the sound of the rain, we were interrupted by a deep male voice that said, \u201cAh yes. Where you said they would be. Very nice. Take care of this.\u201d\n\nI looked to the side and saw a short, fat Asian man in a soaking wet black suit. He was flanked by two much larger, but still short Asians. They were both armed and as I looked towards them, I saw both their lasers flash at the same time.\n"}, "tree": {"": {"Press the hidden button to engage the old elevator": {"The cybernetics in my head flashed and everything goes black\u2026": {"Press the hidden button to engage the old elevator": {"The cybernetics in my head flashed and everything goes black\u2026": {"Press the hidden button to engage the old elevator": {"The cybernetics in my head flashed and everything goes black\u2026": "END"}}}, "Search her for a tracker": {"Go up and look for an escape": {"The cybernetics in my head flashed and everything goes black\u2026": {"Press the hidden button to engage the old elevator": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Digital Consciousness", "stories": {"Welcome to digital conscience...

My body ached, all I could see was their fast moving hands and blood, blood everywhere. A constant beep ringing in my ears, a symphony of unidentifiable sounds almost melodically planned like a rhythm. It started to speed up, my heart racing. I could hear my feet slipping and shaking around under the white plastic bed sheets. I ignored the doctors, I ignored my parents' last attempt of love whispered from above my left shoulder. I ignored my consciousness and my soul I ached, adrenaline was coursing through my veins with the only purpose, to survive. But I heard a few noises, ones that I was not ready for as if they broke the band of heart monitors and acoustic shouting voices.\n\n\n\u201cBang, Bang, bang\u201d\n\n\nScreams were left behind as I felt hoisted up into the air breaking the threads attached to my heart. I felt a cold hand press against my back and a whisper,\n\n\n\u201cHey person, I have a cure\u201d. Then it went silent.\n\n\n    A few minutes later, or that's what it felt like I was placed down into a chair, It was rather uncomfortable considering that I could feel my tail bone underneath it. I had no Idea where I was or why I was here but I did know that we were no longer in the hospital taking into account all that clatter had dissipated. \u201cWhere am I\u201d I listened to keys of a keyboard click as I tried to yank my hands free, as I did that I felt the burns throbbing through my body.\n\n\n \u201cHey kid, drink\u201d, He forcefully tore the black blanket off my head and body and pressed  a blue liquid at lips and beckoned me to drink it.\n\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s my last day anyway\u201d I thought to myself as I tilted my head back for him to pour it down my throat. It felt cold but I embraced it. I felt good for the first time science that fire stripped me of myself and left behind someone hurt, someone who lost their identity. I let my guard down and accepted my fate. It was still almost silent. The only thing breaking it was a leaky faucet seeping through the wooden boards on the ceiling and dripping down into a metal pail. My eyes were still blurry but the man looked like he was wearing glasses, he sat down on a high stool on his computer. His desk looked high tech, almost too new to be down in this run down forgotten space. I saw him grasp two things in his hands, and before I was ready he clamped them onto my arms from the back.\n\n\n    I tried to break free but the rope was too strong, I cried for help but nothing was coming out, I tried to cry but my tears were dry. I tried to see what was happening but I couldn't, I tried to listen but it was quiet, I listened for the leaky faucet but It was gone, everything was gone. \n\n\n   \u201cWas I gone?\u201d I questioned myself, that was the only thing I could do.\n\n\n\u201cDid I die?\u201d I wanted to break free, But I knew I was trapped in this eternal death forever.\n\n\n1,2,3 rebooting software, I saw a light but the light seemed to be coming out of my face.I could see, but all I could see was the person's shirt.\n\n\n\u201cHelp, help\u201d, I wanted him to hear me, \u201cHelp\u201d I shouted even louder. I saw him take his ear buds out of his giant puff of brown hair.\n\n\n\u201cBro, can you shut up for a second?\u201d He said angrily as I heard more of those clicky sounds from earlier.\n\n\n\u201cHelp\u201d I shouted again.\n\n\n\u201cYou know what\u201d He said as he quickly removed a hard drive out of my body. \u201cYou can't talk without this\u201d My eyes slowly started to close and my words started to drown until I was was off.\n", "Continue": "I saw darkness, I was left alone with my thoughts once more. Thump, thump, thump,\n\n\n\u201cHow long am I here for?\u201d I thought to myself. It seemed like an eternity, maybe even longer I missed the ringing in my ears. Maybe death would have been better than this, I was here and I didn\u2019t know where I was, I was somewhere. Maybe I was on the corner of a street, or entering the bar on the corner of town. I could be visiting my parents who are probably stressing out right now.\n\n\n\u201cOh no, what happened to my parents\u201d I thought I said but as time went on I might not have said anything at all. I left my parents behind, I ignored them to the point where they might know or know that I love them.

He slid is fingers under my keyboard but I refused to move anything at all. Then he was gone, like everone in my life. I don't know why I wanted to pull away from him, maybe it was just too painfull.\n\n\n          I waited, and waited for a very long time. untill I saw it one long sunny day It's speckles attempting to wrap themselves around it's body. I saw where the tail lightly blended into those black speckles creating a pallet of beidge stetching up and down the bird . Its blue head hung over gazing down above the silver cars where more birds draped over the sides of the rail from the balcony almmost invisible. I heard the tidewater from my table and throught the cloudy windows quickly rushing up the sand only for it's gentle waters to recede back dragging  its body taking the weak grains of sand with it. I opened my eyes at the colorful town reds oranges and all sorts of colors reminded me of when I was with my family, I saw her face perfectly painted into my imagination, and her warm smile seemed to agree with my thoughts. I saw her nod over and over and over again but she had no thoughts, she wasnt thinking of me. Only frozen in a memory of one I could remember.\n\n\n   Her brown hair shifting along her sholders where she wore her white silk robe tenaciously smoothing her hand to rid the wrinkles. I remember those days sitting on a hammock, my head placed gemtly on her warm chest. It felt cold like ice running throughout her vains  preserving her picture encapsulated forever. A fire burst from behind her head tinging her rome with ash and soot. Her skin began to burn and bubble like tiny worms burrowing beneath her skin gasping for air almost squarming to escape, but she did. Mom she was out of the building I watched as her eyes looked past me,  she ran away leaving me to die. Then those same worms penetrated my skin too. through my legs and under my arms my hair singed with glowing tip. She ran away and never came back, and never came back, and never came ba....\n\n\n\"Chirp\" The bird startled the silence as I slowly began to sigh. I was stuck in a usb drive, in a computer, on a table, in a coffe shop. I watched as the bird broke my consentration and soon later the silver cars engine started to overpower the powerful waves of the ocean carrying out the helpless harmess sand going with the flow. And soon the coffee shop chimes rang and the birds sang in the withering wind and the colors in the town started to blare with loud voices and the heart moniter rang in my ear. \n\n\n\"Clang, clang\" A Concofony of noises, new noises.

It\u2019s pretty interesting. And there are two kinds of interesting\u2019s. One kind is when you're eating your grandfather's cornbread and it tastes drier than a dehydrated turd. Or its legit interesting aka HOLDS INTEREST. I\u2019m not quite sure if this content is \u201cGrandfather\u2019s cornbread\u201d or actually interesting but I guess it depends on the reader. \n\n\nWhy did you make the Main character a computer?\n\n\nWell this was a piece of cake (Cake not cornbread learn the difference). I Like magic gathering, but I didn\u2019t want to make some Harry Potter shit be the best quality of my story game. Also I wanted the story to be more realistic or believable which means less fairy tale and more high tech dystopian even though that is super cliche. \n\n\nWhy is the beginning so weird and hard to follow?\n\n\nI wanted the story to not cover everything about the characters life too quickly, and to gradually feed into the back story. (Like a mouse chewing on cornbread). And I didnt want it to be as confusing as a vampire sparkle cricket. Damn\u2026.damn\u2026.damn\u2026  you get the point. I wanted the reader to keep clicking and reading, that's why I spread out the details like a poop on baking paper. \n\n\nWhat's the character's name? \n\n\nIt says once in the entire story game. Find it \n\n\nWhat is the character's concept design (Who even asks these questions?)\n\n\nHere's a terribly drawn picture\u2026\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you enter the contest in the first place???\n\n\nI Had just gotten back from break and I was like \u201cPhh, work at school is easy I can write a story game no problemo\u201d (That was in january) ?? (February) \u201cHey I have time ill just do it in a few days. (Febuary 22) \u201cOh my god I need to do the story game. I havent even written 3,000 words yet damn\u201d (Now) Phew I finally finished (Ish). \n\n\nA reward for making it this far is to take the Mission if you want (If you find out the name of the main character use it).

By this point, you\u2019re pretty sure you know more about the Selei than they do themselves.  You could have a sophisticated philosophical debate with one of their top historians about the impact of the quantum revolution of the 11300s had on their asteroid mining economy.\n\n\nBut you\u2019re a diplomat, so you don\u2019t say that.  \u201cSorry, the shuttle left late.  There was some kind of technical delay.\u201d\n\n\nVictor grunts.  \u201cWell, you\u2019re here now.  Let\u2019s begin.\u201d\n\n\nYou feel a brief shift in acceleration as the ship begins to move.  You glance out the window.  The stars are as still as ever, but the arms of the docking bay recede into the distance more and more quickly as your ship picks up speed.\n\n\nVictor turns away from the window once the space station is no longer in view.  \u201cAlright folks,\u201d he says.  \u201cThis is the big day.\u201d  He pauses there, presumably for dramatic impact.  \u201cHowever this turns out, I and the rest of the Allied Nations of Earth commend all the good work you\u2019ve put into this.  You\u2019ve all done an incredible job.\u201d\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s done an incredible job except you, that is.  Victor\u2019s right, the researchers and historians sitting at the table around you have done a fantastic job of researching Selei culture and societal standards.  But you haven\u2019t done anything yet, except listen and learn.\n\n\n\u201cNo human has ever attempted to do anything like this before,\u201d begins Victor.  \u201cToday, we\u2019re attempting something that our ancestors could only have dreamed of.  You, sitting before me\u2026\u201d\n\n\nYour mind begins to wander.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been training as a diplomat for years, but as a human trained by humans, that can only go so far.  Humanity\u2019s interactions with the nearby alien nations have only ever been short and tense.  There have been no treaties, no meetings, no officially planned interactions.  Nobody has ever attempted anything like what you\u2019re doing today:  Attempting to negotiate a trade agreement with your galactic neighbors, the Selei.\n\n\nOn one level, you\u2019re fully aware of the momentousness of this occasion.  On the other\u2026 it\u2019s a trade agreement.  It\u2019s not as if the fate of the planet is hanging in the balance here.  You\u2019ve heard Victor\u2019s speech a dozen times before, and are fairly certain that now is a safe time to take a moment for self-reflections.\n\n\nYou glance out the window again.  As always, the stars are perfectly still.  There\u2019s always something a little eerie about traveling at sub-light speeds.  There\u2019s really no sense that the ship is moving at all.\n\n\n-\n\n\nThe Selei ship is quite close by, so even traveling at sub-light speeds it takes you only around twenty minutes to arrive.\n\n\nUpon entering the conference room aboard the Selei ship, you take a moment to appreciate your surroundings.  The Selei seem to prefer an extremely minimalist decoration style, the meeting place is a plain white room, with a plain black table, surrounded by plain black stools.  The only distinguishing feature is the large round window set into the wall, through which you can see your own ship stopped nearby.\n\n\n\u201cThe Selei pay their respects to the Allied Nations of earth,\u201d says the Selan representative, a tall Selan named Laiga, bowing towards you.  He\u2019s speaking in english.  The Selei volunteered their representative to learn your language, as human vocal cords couldn\u2019t pronounce most of their words.\n\n\n\u201cThe Allied Nations of Earth pay their respects to the Selei,\u201d you echo, bowing in return, careful to bow to the exact same height as the Selan representative.  To bow higher would imply you don\u2019t hold as much respect for them as they do for you, whereas bowing deeper would come across as petty one-upmanship.  Either offense would be severe enough to negate any trade agreement your nations might come to.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve seen pictures of the Selei before, but have never met one in person.  Standing here, it really sets in how much taller the Selei are than humans.  Laiga is easily over a foot taller than you, and he\u2019s considered to be of quite average height.  His silvery skin is a little more muted than you had come to expect however, it\u2019s more grayish, and only appears silver when it catches the light\u2019s reflection.\n\n\n\u201cWe greet you open handed,\u201d says Laiga, and you return the gesture.  Now, you\u2019re free to take a seat at the chair set out for you.  As the guest, you\u2019re meant to take a seat first, and then invite the host to join you.  If the host sits first, it implies that the guest is unwelcome.  Also a grievous offense.\n\n\n\u201cHave a seat,\u201d you say, extending your hand.  Laiga sits down, and you breathe a sigh of relief.  You\u2019re far from finished with walking on eggshells, but at least the formalities are over.\n\n\n\u201cMy people do not look favorably on this trade agreement,\u201d says Laiga, as he settles into his chair.\n\n\nYou look up.  This is news to you.  \u201cWhat objection do they have?\u201d  You\u2019re careful to keep your voice tone neutral, and to phrase your request as formally as possible.  The rules governing the implications of voice tone were deemed too complex for you to realistically memorize, so Victor ruled that you should just keep your voice as flat as possible.\n\n\n\u201cMy people are content with our resources,\u201d says Laiga, tapping his fingers together.  \u201cWe have advanced beyond scarcity and have no needs.  Your planet has little to offer us.\u201d\n\n\nGod.  You can\u2019t remember what the finger tapping means.  Constanza did briefly mention finger tapping in her presentation on Selan hand gestures, but she said it almost certainly would never come up.  You wrack your memory.\n\n\n\u201cSurely this cannot be determined by the survey teams you have sent,\u201d you say.\n\n\nYou\u2019re taking a risk here, but you think it\u2019s worth it.  The Selan people consider rash decision-making to be among the worst offenses possible, and you\u2019re semi-implying that the Selan people have committed this sin on a planetary scale.  It may force Laiga to take a more open-minded stance, but if he decides to take offense, you\u2019re in for it.\n\n\nLaiga blinks.  His face is impassive to you, there was no way to research typical Selan face expressions before the meeting.  You have to hope he\u2019s equally in the dark about what your expressions mean.  \u201cOf course, we know only little of your planet\u2019s resources.  However, we have interacted much with your ships and technology.  Your primitive people display only a limited knowledge of the application of these resources.\u201d\n\n\nWhat the hell?  He can call your entire race primitive to your face, but you can\u2019t double-knot your shoes without seeming pretentious?  Is he just fucking with you?\n\n\nHe\u2019s insulted you twice to your face, first by the primitive comment, and now he\u2019s clasping his hands in front of him.  A clear statement that he considers you and your relatives inferior to his.  You\u2019re suddenly feeling unsure in your knowledge of Selan culture.  The suspicious sentiment itself isn't wholly unexpected--you've known that the Selei can be proud, and many consider themselves superior to other races.  However, your impression had been that this difference in advancement instead made them more inclined to be generous (albeit condescending) with the less advanced.\n\n\nNo, what really concerns you is that your team had assumed that the wide variety of formal procedures and etiquette meant that politeness was of the utmost importance.  But it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s even remotely true.  By Selan standards, Laiga is practically trash-talking you here.\n", "Clasp your hands in front of you": "You clasp your hands in front of you.  Perhaps the Selan people are of a combative nature, and just use their etiquette systems as a further means to insult each other.\n\n\nThe moment you do, you realize you\u2019ve made some kind of mistake.  Laiga\u2019s eyes visibly narrow.  \u201cMy people have little use for trade with a culture with no sense of humility.\u201d\n\n\nThe negotiation ends there.  You and Laiga spend another few minutes going back and forth about the importance of cultural exchange and potential benefits of your planet\u2019s biodiversity, but you can tell that whatever possibility there was of reaching an agreement, it\u2019s gone.\n\n\nVictor\u2019s pissed, of course, but surprisingly it isn\u2019t entirely at you.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell, people!\u201d he raves, already on his third lap around the circular conference table.  \u201cYou all assured me that the Selei placed heavy, heavy weight on conversational structure and politeness.  So what gives?  What fucking gives?\u201d\n\n\nConstanza cringes.  \u201cDr. Karvink, every inquiry we made suggested that was the case.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, then clearly you weren\u2019t making enough inquiries!\u201d  Victor is now on his fifth lap around the table, and is starting to lose steam.  He stops at the front of the room.  \u201cOkay, fine.  Maybe you were misinformed.  Maybe this Laiga guy was just batshit crazy.  I can understand that, but I want an explanation for this.  Get me a report on how this went wrong, and why.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these that remind you of why you are the diplomat and not Victor.  He\u2019s right, this was an unmitigated disaster, but you don\u2019t go up there and say it was an unmitigated disaster.  You say there were a few unanticipated roadblocks or something.  Metaphors are good.\n\n\nVictor does eventually get his report, but you don\u2019t have time to read it yourself, and there\u2019s no way of knowing how accurate it is.  The Selei have always been a closed, private people, and since you failed to negotiate with them, they\u2019ve pretty much shut off contact with you.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the world.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea.\n", "Months Pass": "\u201cIf they\u2019re refuse to agree on a meeting time, then I don\u2019t see why we need to stick around,\u201d grumbles Victor.\n\n\n\u201cLook, we really shouldn\u2019t push this one,\u201d you say.  \u201cInsisting on a definite time would be considered a sign of weakness.  The Kaagar think that a warrior should be battle-ready at all times.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a warrior,\u201d points out Victor.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well don\u2019t tell that to the Kaagar,\u201d you say.  \u201cIt was hard enough to persuade them to meet with someone other than our nation\u2019s god-emperor.\u201d\n\n\nAfter the first three incidents with the Kaagar nearly ended in outright war, you\u2019re hoping this fourth one is going to go a little better.  Your research shows that the Kaagar make a practice of always being at war, particularly with nations they consider weak and unworthy.  They hold with contempt the idea of desiring peace, thinking it makes a nation weak.  Naturally, this has made foreign relations with them a little testy.\n\n\nThis meeting is going to be an experience.  As far as you know, the Kaagar have no trained diplomats, and will make utterly no attempts to compromise or to follow cultural conventions\u2014and, you have no idea what behavior they consider socially acceptable.  On the one hand, all bets are off\u2014they\u2019re not following any protocol, and in this meeting they could say or so anything.  On the other hand, you\u2019re certain none of them have ever taken the time to study your nation\u2019s import export patterns.  If you are able to secure an agreement, you\u2019re optimistic of getting one in earth\u2019s favor.\n\n\nThat said, you\u2019ve been loitering in this sector for the past two days.  The Kaagar said they\u2019d turn up at some point, but if this goes on much longer, you\u2019re seriously considering writing this \u201cnegotiation\u201d off as an elaborate prank.\n\n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of brushing your teeth when it finally happens.  \u201cThey\u2019ve arrived!\u201d Victor yells excitedly over the comm system.  You spit into the sink as quickly as you can, and dash out into the hall, where you run headfirst into another shipmate who had the same idea.  You rub your forehead and wince.  Hey, if you develop a black eye, maybe it\u2019ll convince the Kaagar that you\u2019re battle-hardened.\n\n\nThe Kaagar ship docks reasonably well with your own, despite the systems being completely incompatible.  The Kaagar designed their ships to dock with anything, to make the mid-combat boarding of enemy vessels easier.  Ironically, this tool of war will now be used for negotiation.\n\n\n\u201cPressure stable,\u201d says the computer.\n\n\nNow it\u2019s time to engage in a little thing you\u2019ve decided to call \u201cAirlock diplomacy\u201d.  That isn\u2019t a joke.  The Kaagar refused to meet on your ship, and wouldn\u2019t let you onto theirs, so this was the solution you came up with.\n\n\nYou hurriedly step into the airlock.  The Kaagar are three days overdue, but that doesn\u2019t give you any excuse to be late.\n\n\n\u201cEarth warrior!\u201d booms a voice.  You start in surprise.  It\u2019s not the volume, although it is quite loud, but this is your first time hearing the Kaagan language spoken by an actual Kaagan.  It\u2019s a much deeper, more guttural language than you anticipated.  You\u2019re suddenly unsure if you can speak it correctly, despite all your practice.\n\n\n\u201cWarriors of Kaagar!\u201d you greet in return, scratching your throat painfully as you try to mimic the sound of the language.  The lighting in the airlock is poor, but you can still see their basic outline.  The Kaagar are humanoid, but covered with plate-like scales that are each several inches across.  They can\u2019t be very agile with all armor, but then, they don\u2019t need to be.\n\n\nOne of the Kaagans steps forwards and abruptly pulls out a dagger.  \u201cGive us one reason not to conquer your ship and seize its technology!\u201d\n\n\nOh good lord.  Is this always how the Kaagar begin negotiations?\n", "Charge the lead Kaagan in a show of strength.": "No point in showing any kind of weakness.  You charge forwards with a roar, and predictably, get shanked by the Kaagan knife.\n\n\nWhen the security guards outside the airlock rush in after hearing you scream, they find the Kaagan delegation in an extremely good mood.  They were considerably impressed by your bravery and patriotism, and are quite favorably inclined towards establishing relations with your species.  After a few months of negotiation, this blossoms into a prosperous alliance.\n\n\nSo, congrats, I guess.  You\u2019re still dead, though.\n", "\u201cBecause to conquer this ship, you would have to get past me.\u201d": "The Kaagan laughs, and sheathes his dagger.  You don\u2019t get the impression he ever seriously intended to use it.\n\n\n\u201cI commend your bravery!\u201d he says, and reaches out a hand, as if asking for a handshake.  When you hesitantly reach out your own in return, he seizes your forearm, squeezing hard enough with his rough hand to bring tears to your eyes.  \u201cI am Shathtar Wyrmslayer.  Let this bond between our nations make our people shout with joy, and our enemies tremble in fear!\u201d\n\n\nOkay, well this is moving a little more quickly than you can anticipated.  \u201cI certainly appreciate your enthusiasm,\u201d you say.  \u201cBut my understanding was we were coming here to discuss a trade deal, not a formal alliance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn unimportant difference,\u201d dismisses the Kaagan.  \u201cIf your people will follow us into battle, then we will share with our allies whatever we have!\u201d\n\n\nAn alliance with the Kaagan was the ultimate end goal of these negotiations.  You decide to go for it.  \u201cVery well.  The United Nations of Earth look forward to a long and prosperous alliance between our people!\u201d\n\n\nFor the next hour, you engage in what is by far the strangest negotiation of your life.  The Kaagar aren\u2019t even slightly concerned with negotiating fair trade deals, or nailing down details about the nature of your alliance.  They seem perfectly willing to accept this alliance on word of mouth, without any formal agreements  or documents backing it up at all.  At the end of the session, you secure a military research trade agreement, and the promise of future discussions.  This is a deal strongly in Earth\u2019s favor.  Though your two nations are  roughly equally advanced, the Kaagar have poured much more scientific research into military technology, and are leagues ahead of you there.\n\n\nFor the first time since the Selei negotiations, you see Victor in an extremely good mood.\n\n\n\u201cExcellent work everyone,\u201d he says.  \u201cEveryone in this room deserves a promotion.  Everyone in this room deserves two promotions.  I will be speaking directly to my superiors about getting everyone in this room two promotions.\u201d\n\n\nEarth Central seems to share his enthusiasm.  Within a few weeks, you and the Kaagar have agreed on several mutually beneficial trade deals, and have signed aa pact promising mutual wartime support.  It seems as though a firm alliance is in the making.\n\n\nMost of you and your team wind up with one promotion, which Victor thinks is criminal negligence, but you, on the whole, are pretty happy with.\n", "\u201cSeizing this ship would be an act of war against the Allied Nations of Earth. Are your people really prepared for war with a species as technologically advanced as your own?\u201d": "\u201cWe are prepared for war with any race too weak to defend themselves,\u201d snarls the Kaagan.\n", "\u201cWe came here to negotiate a trade deal. If all you\u2019re interested in doing is trying to threaten us, then I don\u2019t see why we\u2019re here.\u201d": "The Kaagan bares his teeth.  \u201cIf your people are not committed to fighting for what is yours, then I see no use in working out any agreement with a weaker race.\u201d  Abruptly, he turns around, and stalks back the way he came.\n\n\n\u201cHey\u2014!\u201d you say, and then trail off.  They clearly have no intention of returning.  The Kaagan representatives are just\u2026 gone.  What the hell just happened?\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d demands Victor.\n\n\n\u201cSir, I think you need to calm down,\u201d begins Constanza.\n\n\n\u201cI need to calm down?  I think the Kaagar are the ones who need to calm down!  What the hell was that?\u201d\n\n\nYou\u2019re as baffled as he is, though admittedly you\u2019re less vocal about it.  \u201cMy best guess is I broke some kind of cultural taboo without realizing it.  We don\u2019t have nearly as much information on the Kaagar\u2019s social rules as we did the Selei.\u201d  And even that hadn\u2019t helped much.\n\n\nVictor exhales slowly.  \u201cDo you have any idea how serious this was?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe \u2018weaker race\u2019 comment is concerning,\u201d you say.  \u201cThey pretty much tend to attack \u2018weaker races\u2019 on sight.  But they must not consider us weak if they were willing to negotiate in the first place, so that could have been bluster rather than a hint at planned policy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBluster\u2026 good grief.  Maybe it\u2019s just as well we can\u2019t get an alliance with them.  The last thing we want to do is be dealing with space tough guys.\u201d\n\n\nInitially, you were inclined to agree with him.  Then, the reports of attacks along the border started coming in.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I insulted them that badly!\u201d you explode, storming into the briefing.\n\n\n\u201cThis is clearly about something more,\u201d agrees Constanza.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been attacking strategic outposts.  They\u2019ve got to be after our resources.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEarth Central wants to try a diplomatic solution,\u201d says Victor.  \u201cBased on what we know of their military\u2026 we don\u2019t have much of a chance against them if this war goes on much longer.  We\u2019ve got a meeting with the Kaagar in a couple days, and Earth Central is prepared to offer up just about any of our off-world assets in order to end the war.\u201d\n\n\nYou spend the next few days studying up on Earth\u2019s territories and mining colonies, as well as the Kaagar\u2019s attack patterns and strategies, just in case.  By the end of the briefings, you could list Earth\u2019s colonies backwards alphabetically, and can name sixteen different types of typical Kaagar attack patterns.\n\n\nBut it all turns out to be for nothing.\n\n\nThe Kaagar diplomat\u2019s ship opens negotiations by firing on yours.  Though your ships returns fire almost immediately, several sections of the ship were completely destroyed.  Including the section with your sleeping quarters.\n\n\nIf the war can be brought to a peaceful end at all, it\u2019ll have to be done by someone else.\n", "Continue to negotiate": "There\u2019s too little information for you to risk insulting him like that.  Sure, it could be some kind of cultural challenge, but you have no way of knowing.  Best to keep to your prepared facts.\n\n\nLaiga is opening aggressively by bringing up his people\u2019s reluctance to make a deal.  You could meet that stance by pulling out your big gun, your planet\u2019s biodiversity.  Most medicines originate from organic compounds, and your planet has far more unique organic compounds than Selei does.  Or you could argue that mutual cultural exchange will benefit both of your species progress.  History has shown that to often be the case.\n", "\"While we may not be as technologically advanced as the Selei, our planet has a range of biodiversity far beyond yours. Access to our biosphere could provide the Selei with technology and medicines you previously didn\u2019t have the resources to make.\u201d": "\u201cThe Selei have no need for technology and medicines,\u201d says Laiga.  \u201cOur needs are provided for us by the resources of our own people.  We have no need for the help of lesser cultures.\u201d\n\n\nYou go back and forth for a while about how can the Selei really know what they\u2019re missing until they at least take a look, but Laiga insists that his people have solved all their pressing medical issues and have no need of alien resources.\n\n\nIt\u2019s useless.  Eventually, you wind up half-agreeing with him.  If his people really do have all the resources they need, why would they bother to trade with any other nation?\n\n\nOf course, Victor doesn\u2019t quite see it that way.\n\n\n\u201cLook, what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d interrupts Victor, cutting off your explanation.  \u201cWhy would the Selei agree to a meeting if they weren\u2019t open to the possibility of trade?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them that,\u201d you say, starting to lose your patience.  You were just as misinformed about the standards of this meeting as Victor was.\n\n\nThe Selei aren\u2019t around, so Victor instead fields his question to the room.  \u201cCan anybody here explain to me why the Selei would arrange a trade negotiation meeting with a species they weren\u2019t willing to trade with?\u201d\n\n\nConstanza rubs her forehead.  \u201cDr. Karvink, we had every indication that the Selei were perfectly willing to trade.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell then clearly you weren\u2019t making enough inquiries!\u201d  Victor sighs.  \u201cOkay, fine.  Maybe you were misinformed.  Maybe this Laiga guy was just playing hardball for no reason.  I can understand that, but I want an explanation for this.  Get me a report on how this went wrong, and why.\u201d\n\n\nVictor does eventually get his report, but you don\u2019t have time to read it yourself, and there\u2019s no way of knowing how accurate it is.  The Selei have always been a closed, private people, and since you failed to negotiate with them, they\u2019ve pretty much shut off contact with you.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the world.

Laiga\u2019s apparent hostility towards you seems to drop away bit by bit as you talk, and by the time the conversation has finished, he\u2019s addressed you by your first name twice, an indication that he considers you to be trustworthy.  You leave the negotiating room with high spirits, a favorable trade deal, and the prospects of a more serious alliance sometime in the future.\n\n\nBy the time you arrive back at the main ship, the team is already celebrating.  \u201cExcellent work!\u201d says Victor, clapping you on the back and knocking the wind out of you.\n\n\nAfter chatting for a few minutes about the negotiations, talk turns to the future.  \u201cHave you been given our next assignment yet?\u201d you ask.\n\n\nVictor nods.  \u201cCentral thinks we\u2019ve got a shot at making contact with the Kaagar again, so the team and I are going to be studying up on their culture.\u201d\n\n\nHis choice of syntax doesn\u2019t escape you.  \u201cThe team and you\u2026 but not me?\u201d\n\n\nHe shakes his head.  \u201cYou\u2019re currently the world\u2019s foremost expert on Selan culture and diplomacy.

Let's fight!\"\n\n\nYou dodge out of the way of one raider's wild haymaker, and chop him right in the throat. His head comes clean off from the power of the blow. Next, you deflect a kick and respond with a roundhouse to the raider's head, making it explode in a shower of blood and brains.\n\n\nThe fight doesn't last too long, and before you know it you've defeated them all.\n\n\n... Now what?\n", "Ending 7: Super Skyrim Special Edition Turbo Advanced Featuring Dante From The Devil May Cry Series": "You grab the nearest drink and swig it down, only to pull it away from yourself and cough violently. \"Woah, that's a little... Strong...\" You look at the bottle in your hand, seeing that it reads \"sleeping juice\". \"... Oh no.\"\n\n\nThe last thing you hear before you pass out is a man saying \"see that mountain? You can climb it.\"\n\n\nYou wake up in a carriage, a cold breeze hitting your face. A blond man across from you says \"hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.\"\n\n\nOh no.\n\n\nYou look back at the trail, seeing one of the raiders snickering. He grabs a hold of his face, and tears it off... Revealing Todd Howard, disguised as a typical Badlands thug.\n\n\nSon of a bitch.\n", "The Saloon": "You look around the saloon, the only thing catching your interest being a crate in the back that shakes violently. Curious. You can either check it out, or just grab some water and get out of here.\n", "Ending 8: Poison Corgis Are Dangerous, Y'Know": "You punch the crate open and reach around inside, only to get a bite on your hand. You yelp in pain and pull your hand back, finding that there's a bright orange corgi with red eyes latched onto your hand. Swatting him off, you watch him run off with a little yelp.\n\n\nBehind you, you hear a rasping laugh. \"Ha... Ha... Ha...\" You look and see one of the raiders that's still barely alive.\n\n\n\"What's so funny? You're the idiot that's dying.\"\n\n\n\"That... Was our... Poison... Corgi...\"\n\n\n\"Poison corgi?! A-aren't those extinct?!\"\n\n\n\"Nope... See ya... Sucker... Blurgh...\" He dies on the spot. And now you're poisoned. Crap, you gotta find the antidote and fast!\n\n\nBefore you can even move, your body seizes up and you fall to the floor with a thud. Well, poison corgi venom is highly potent. Guess you have to see it to believe it.\n", "Ending 9: You Got Your Water": "You find a bottle behind the bar labeled \"water\" and take it, sticking the bottle into your knapsack and leaving the saloon. You wander off in search of adventure, your thirst quenched and your fists bloodied.\n\n\nIt was a good day.\n", "Ending 10: Just A Little Drink": "The four of you all have a nice drink together. They even pay for your drink themselves! How nice of them. You leave the town not long after, with you promising that if you're in the area again you'll drop by to see them. What nice guys.\n\n\nGuess today you learned that not all raiders are bad. Maybe all they want is a friend.\n", "Right Into The Fight": "You jump up to your feet and deliver a powerful punch to the leader. He goes flying into a nearby saloon, his two goons looking in surprise at the wrecked building for a moment. With a grin, you rush forward, and they turn around just in time for your feet to smack right into their faces! The two are sent flying just like their buddy, landing on him just as he was getting up.\n\n\nGrin widening, you yell \"YEAH!\" as a show of victory... And then see a bunch of raiders walking right out of the saloon you just screwed up. There's at least twenty guys, and they all look a lot more competent than the three guys you just beat up.\n\n\nThey're heading right for you. What do you do?\n", "Ending 1: Tactical Retreat!": "You're not dumb enough to stick around and lose this fight! Instead, you turn tail and run like hell away from the town and the raiders within. Your fear makes you so fast, everything just becomes a blur. You think you see the town a few times as you run, but you're not too sure. Once you think you've run long and fast enough away from the town, you stop, panting on your hands and knees.\n\n\nYou chuckle, picking yourself up, and jump back.\n\n\nYou're right back at the entrance of the town. And there's a mob of raiders that look extremely pissed off.\n\n\nNeedless to say, you don't exactly live to tell the tale.\n", "Stick Around": "You stare them dead on as they approach, getting into a fighting stance. The group reaches you in no time, and the man leading the group, who's twice your size in both height and width, looks down on you with a bored expression. \"So what's all this about then?\" he asks, in a surprisingly gentle voice.\n", "ATATATATATATATATATATATA-ATAAAAH!": "You let out a wild flurry of fast jabs at his ample body, each blow shaking his belly violently. Still, he stands stone still against the attack, still staring down at you. You finish off the flurry with a strong uppercut right into his belly button, and promptly turn away. Once you finish, he starts to laugh heartily. \"HAHAHA! Was that supposed to hurt? Your fists are like mosquito stings!\"\n\n\nYou grace him with only one response: \"Omae wa mou shindeiru.\"\n\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\n\nWithout another word, he explodes in a shower of blood and gore the likes of which the Badlands have never seen. The raiders gasp in shock as they watch their fearless leader die.\n", "Ending 3: Wandering Warrior": "There's nothing left to do here. Without their leader, the raiders will fall into disarray and disband, so your work is done. You simply walk away in the direction you entered the town from, the raiders not even bothering to attack you out of a mixture of fear and respect.\n\n\nOnce you're a mile out of town, you come to a realization: you never even got a drink. But the Badlands have been ridden of a menace, and that's what counts. Content, you keep walking, intent on wiping out the rest of the scum of the Badlands.\n\n\nThat is if you don't die of thirst before then. Can't get a decent drink anywhere these days.\n", "Ending 4: Raider King": "You turn around to face the raiders, only to see that they're... Bowing to you?

He doesn't look up. \"Uh, what's going on here?\"\n\n\nHe lets out a yelp of fear. \"T-the raider code says that anyone who bests our leader in combat will become our new leader!\"\n\n\nYou scratch your chin, grinning at the answer. \"Leader eh?\"\n\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\n\"Well then, minions. My first act as leader... Is for you guys to get me something to drink!\"\n\n\nThey all scamper off back to the saloon and return with a tall glass of ice cold water. You chug it down and let out a sigh of relief. Now that's some good shit. \"Alright guys, pack it up. We're gonna go on a little adventure!\"\n\n\nThe raiders cheer, and with that you lead your new minions into the sunset.\n", "Ending 2: A Civil Conversation": "The large man nods at your words. \"Ah, yes, those three are always causing trouble. We're really terribly sorry, my boy. They're as much a pain in our behinds as they are yours, ohohoho!\" He laughs heartily, and you join in.\n\n\n\"My, it is quite hot out here, no? What say we return to the saloon for some scones and tea?\" you proposition, and the large man laughs yet again.\n\n\n\"Very well! Come, men!

With all his heart, he knew that he could make a difference in this desolate place, and change it for the better!\n\n\n...

Hopefully, it won't be Raiderville like the last place you visited. Maybe they'll even give you water. They gotta have a well or something.\n\n\nYou stop in your tracks. You hear something approaching, heading towards you from behind... A vehicle? Slowly, you turn around, wondering just what it-\n\n\nHOLY SHIT IT'S A SAND WHALE.\n\n\nSand Whales aren't actual whales in the sand, though you suppose it wouldn't be too out of place if actual sand whales existed. No, Sand Whales are massive tanks made of scrap metal, utilized by roving bands of raiders. They vary when it comes to size, being anywhere from the size of a small shack to dwarfing the buildings one would find in a ruined city.\n\n\nAnd this one... It's one of the bigger ones you've seen. From your limited knowledge of math, the vehicle has to be at least ten feet tall!

Once you reach it, you find it to be a bit bigger than you expected, albeit that's not saying much. The buildings are all glorified shacks made of whatever materials the locals could scavenge, though you do note a nicer looking one made of scrap metal in the center of the town.\n\n\nPeople are milling about the area, dressed in everything from rags, grimy pre-war clothes, or even makeshift armor. You yell to gather the attention of the town, \"HEY, EVERYBODY! THERE'S A SAND WHALE COMING THIS WAY, WE GOTTA WORK FAST IF WE WANT TO FIGHT THE BANDITS OFF!\"\n\n\n... No one hears you. A few people glance at you, but otherwise don't pay you any mind. You grab the nearest person, a man in a ratty old straw hat. \"Didn't you hear me? There's raiders coming, man!\"\n\n\nHe shakes off your hands, glaring at you. \"Oh yeah? Whadda these raiders look like, then? Oh, wait, they probably don't exist!

Who knew people could be so rude?\n\n\nOnce you're a few miles out, you hear screams and gunfire in the distance, and turn around to see the Sand Whale stopped right in front of the tiny village.

Before they all break out into cheers and applause! Now that's more like it! With a small smile on your face, you make to leave...\n\n\n\"Wait!\" a small child yells, running up to you. \"Don't go!

And wait.\n\n\nIt takes about an hour for the Sand Whale to finally get there, where it promptly stops. The hatch on the front opens. You prepare for a raiding party... But instead face a man in a bright orange safety vest, with two glowing sticks in his hands. He ignores you entirely, instead running around to the back of the Sand Whale, where he begins to wave it.\n\n\nThere's a high-pitched beeping sound as the Sand Whale slowly goes backwards, onto a more stable and flat piece of land. You have to blink to make sure you're not seeing this. Just... What?\n\n\nEventually, the Sand Whale settles down, and the safety vest guy runs back into the still open hatch. Then the raiders emerge. Five of them, to be exact... All dressed in spandex. Brightly colored spandex, you may add.\n\n\nThere's a dramatic staredown, them glaring at you, and you with a dumbfounded look on your face, before...\n\n\n\"BEAR with me now!\" the one in red yells as he strikes a dramatic pose.\n\n\n\"I'm home, DEER!\" the one in yellow shouts as he strikes a dramatic pose of his own.\n\n\n\"My my, you're FOX-y!\" the one in green strikes a dramatic pose of her own.\n\n\n\"Need a HARE-cut?!\" that's the blue one.\n\n\n\"BOAR... Something! I'll kick your ass!\" The others stop to stare at the one in purple as he finishes his battle cry.\n\n\n\"Rick, what the fuck? That sucked!\" Red shouts.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry! I don't know why I picked an animal that I couldn't base a pun around!\" the one in purple, Rick, shoots back defensively.\n\n\nThe others just groan and shrug... Before going right back into their poses. Then, together, they shout, \"WE ARE! THE FOREST FIVE!\"\n\n\nDouchebags.\n", "Ending 8: Spandex Covered Douchebags": "You stare at them for a moment...

My God, if I knew you guys were in the Sand Whale, I wouldn't have tried to defend this town!\" You wipe a tear away from your eye, then let out a sigh. \"Man... You had me going! I'm just gonna go, you guys have fun screwing up this village.\"\n\n\nThey all stand there with pouts on their faces as you walk away.\n\n\n\"See Rick, this is your fault!

Like 'BEAR with me' is any better!\"\n", "Fighting Douchebags Dressed In Spandex": "You grin, and get into a battle stance. \"Alright, Douchebag Five! Let's fight!\"\n\n\n\"That was not a funny play on our name! That was just an insult!\" the red one retorts.\n\n\n\"SHUT UP AND FIGHT ME!\" you return. That gets them to charge at you, fists flailing wildly. You step out of the way of Rick's charge, and stick out your leg to trip him. He falls to the ground with a yell.\n\n\n\"Oh fuck, oh fuck! Ouch! You scraped my knee, dude!\" He holds his knee to his body, letting out a hiss of pain. That usual dumbfounded look makes its way back onto your face.\n\n\n\"Uh... Come again?\"\n\n\n\"FOOL! YOU FELL FOR IT! SURPRISE AMBUSH!\" Blue yells from behind, leaping out and wrapping his arms around you. He pulls you to the ground, and you let out a shout of mingled surprise and pain. Damn, they got you!\n\n\nYou manage to reverse the hold after a moment, and drag yourself up to your feet while still holding Blue in your arms. The others charge at you, but you hold them off with a few kicks. Then, Rick jumps up and applies a chokehold. Crap, this isn't good!\n\n\nYou let go of Blue, who promptly begins to punch you. The others join the attack. If this keeps up, you'll die! You have to do something!\n", "Ending 9: SAND WHALE": "You look behind them, feigning shock on your face. \"Oh my God, what the fuck is that?!\" They all stop and turn around. There's nothing there for a moment...\n\n\nThen an actual whale leaps forth from the sand and onto the Sand Whale they emerged from, crushing it. It wiggles around for a bit, before slipping back into the sand. They all stare in shock, Blue's grip on you loosening. You blink in surprise as well...

Your feet step across the ancient, concrete floor, as the shops and houses rise on both sides like two vast cliffs. If you look for long enough, you can see the blinking, flashing lights of The Upcity above, above the smog. It is said that the people lucky enough to live up there can see something called \"The Sky\", a sort of endless void not covered by a ceiling or smog, but you suspect that's just a myth.\n\n\nAs you sneak through the markets, selling all sorts of exotic items, such as energy weapons and ration bars, you hear shouting coming from behind you and turn to see figures approaching. The men are instantly recognisable; their uniforms, constantly flashing blue and red, mark them out to be Upcity Police. Strange, you've seen them in Holographic News Reports but they never come down this far...\n\n\nTheir leader looks at you, points and instantly shouts to his men; \"Alright boys :get that one!\"\n\n\nBefore you can even run, one of them pulls out a gun, fires a circle of blue energy at you, and everything goes black...\n\n\nYou awaken, groggily. You're surrounded by metal bars in a very bright, dirty-white room: an Upcity Prison Cell.\n\n\n\"They're awake,\" says one of the guards.\n\n\nWhat do you do?\n", "Demand to know what is going on": "A figure approaches you. He wears a ScreenCoat - a coat which, instead of fabric, is made out of a single screen that, in this case, displays a huge advertisement \"Choose NextDesire - the only Brain Chip with a FULLY customisable Desire setting!\" \n\n\n\"Ah,\" says the man, \"But of course. Residents of Underville have, if you will pardon the pun, been 'kept in the dark' about all the things going on up here. Rest assured, I, Desmond Nexter, as the head of Security Affairs, will explain everything to you. You have been chosen for an extremely important mission, one that it is not an exaggeration to say will define the trajectory of our entire world. But first, some background. Historically, implants have always been very crude little things. The first of which were known as \"hearing aids\"; little machines that could allow people with audio problems to hear better. But as the years went on, government scientists managed to make these implants more and more advanced, and coupled with advancements in neuroscience, were able to create the most powerful device in the history; The Desire Chip. With this, a person could modify their own brain and change their own desires to anything that they wanted. The affect this had on society was immense; we used to have problems with people who did not enjoy work, for example. They would toil away, hours on end, doing menial tasks they did not enjoy. But the Desire Chip changed all that; people would simply insert the Chip, then alter their own Desire Setting, and make it so that they wanted nothing better to do with their lives than these menial tasks. Workload increased tenfold overnight, and the best part is, this was fully voluntary - people were so bored with their lives that they would take any option to make these jobs more pleasurable.\"\n\n\n\"What does this have to do with me?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"I'm glad you asked,\" says Desmond, \"You see, a group of extremists live outside here, far away. They managed to separate themselves from society, a long time ago, because they had some bizzare objection to this. They were always thought to be a bit of a joke, however, we have reason to suspect they are now far more dangerous. They have aquired access to a computer device that could spell doom for all of us. They stole it from us a few weeks ago, and this device has the ability to control everyone's Chips; alter our desires to whatever these maniacs want! If, for example, they wanted all of us on the surface to be their slaves, they could. We believe the only reason we're safe is because they haven't broken the encryption on the coomputer, but as soon as they do, we're in trouble. Now, we would love to send some of our own guards after them, but they have developed an extremely powerful defence mechanism...every single one of our guards has a Desire Chip, which makes them love their jobs. However, the extremists have developed a signal that scrambles Chips within its radius; every guard we have sent comes out of it hating us and quitting on the spot. Luckily, that signal only covers their camp...for now. This is why we made the decision to recruit somebody from the Underville; your lot, descendents of criminals and vagabonds, have not been augmented with Chips in this way, so you should be able to pass through. So this is where you come in; I will give you a USB containing a program that will instantly shut down their Computer. This USB will be tied to your DNA - only you will be able to use it on the Device, nobody else will. You must get into their camp and upload it, and in return, you shall be granted not only your total freedom, but your very own house in the Upcity and a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. Any questions?\"\n", "Agree to set out on the journey": "You agree to set out on the journey.\n\n\n\"Excellent!\" Says Desmond, and hands you a USB, \"This contains the program needed to turn off the extremists' computer. Plug it in, and then get out of there. Step outside and, when you are ready, get inside the black and white van. It will take you to where you need to go. But do not get any funny ideas about trying to run away...we have implanted an invisible tag on you that will show us where you are, at all times.\"\n\n\nYou step outside, and the sight of the Upcity and night takes your breath away.\n\n\nIt is so loud here; the traffic passing by, the roads filled with flying vehicles hooting and honking away. Buildings rise up, covered in lights that temporarily blind your eyes that have lived their whole lives in darkness. You look up, and see something that puts all these things to shame. The sky. A black void, rising far, far above you. You stare into it, your mind almost blanking. You have spent your whole life without ever seeing this and it should be totally alien to you, yet somehow, deep down, this feels like the most familiar thing you have ever seen in your life.\n\n\nYou finally look back to the street. On the other side of the road is a building, taller than any of the others, marked \"The Land Of Untapped Desire.\" The guards in the Black and White van are asleep, they willl not notice if you go in there for a little while...\n", "Go to the Land of Untapped Desire": "You enter the building. The carpet alone must be worth more than everything in the Underville combined, and it is by far the cleanest place you could ever have dreamed of. \n\n\nThere is nobody at the desk, yet somehow you get the feeling you are being watched. Suddenly, great, 3D purple word appear in midair...a hologram. They say \"PLEASE WAIT...\", and a holographic hourglass appears next to these words. After a few minutes, they vanish, and a woman with flowing red haird steps through the white doors in front of you.\n\n\n\"Ah, you must be the Unaltered One,\" she says, \"I know all about you...very little goes on in this City that I do not know about. Come, follow me, don't be shy, and I will explain to you what you really should be doing with that USB.\"\n\n\nDo you follow her?\n", "A walk in the woods": "Having been around the Upcity enough, you step into the black and white van, and onto the black, clean seats.\n\n\n\"Right,\" says the driver, \"It's time. Strap in, this is going to be a long ride...\"\n\nThe van speeds off, down the road.\n\n\nYou realise, as you are speeding along, that all the other cars outside your vehicle are flying, but your van has wheels. You ask the driver why this is.\n\n\n\"Those flying cars only work on the roads,\" he explains, \"The roads have an electromagnetic track underneath them which allow the cars to levitate. We are going far away from the Upcity, where the roads are all just dirt and sand, with no tracks underneath. \n\n\nYou wonder what \"dirt\" and \"sand\" even are.\n\n\nYou travel for a few hours through the glowing metropolis, and you notice that the most common thing you see are adverts; some for soda, others for films and Holo-Series that are coming out in the future.\n\n\nEventually, you come out of the City and into a wide, flat plain. The entire land is covered in millions of small plants that look like tiny, upright yellow strands. The driver explains that this plant is \"grass\", and the area you in is called the \"Grass Land\" because of it.\n\n\nYou look ahead, and realise you are driving into something. A line of huge, towering plants the size of buildings with brown, hard stems and green tops reach into the sky.\n\n\n\"What on earth is that?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"That is where you will be going,\" says the Driver, \"That is the Forest, and it is where the extremists make their home.\"\n\n\nIt looks terrifying, as you have never seen anything like it in your life.\n\n\n\"Better you than me,\" says the Driver, \"I don't know what lurks under those trees, among the leaves, and I don't want to find out. If it weren't for the freaks inside, we would have destroyed this place ages ago, but they seem to have prepared for everything-even our Helicopter pilots freak out when they get to close, and all A.I. simply jams around here.\"\n\n\nTrees? He must mean the giant plants. He doesn't get to close to the forest and lets you out on the plains. He promises to wait there, as the field prevents him from going any further.\n\n\nYou walk across the plains, and the strange taste of the air fills your senses. So many things that you never even imagined are out here, and yet every aspect of your being seems to be more at home here than you ever were in civilisation. Finally, you make it to the forest. There is a a series of metal pylons around the wood-the field emitters. You take a deep breath, find a path, and walk in.\n\n\nYou step on the path, and hear a crunch, making you yelp and jump back. Looking closer, you see the floor is covered in strange, dry plant-matter that made the crunching sound. Are these...the leaves?\n\n\nYou look around the forest, and you hear a twittering noise. Something sits in the tree, covered in a soft, blue material. It seems to be a tiny animal, with two wings, and a beak. You gasp - this can only be the fabled creature known as a \"bird\"! The most exotic animal you have ever seen are the rats in the Underville, and you didn't believe the myths about ancient creatures known as \"pigeon-birds\" that supposedly lived in the Underville before they went extinct. As if animals could fly without aid! Yet here is one, alive and in the flesh.\n\n\n\"Beautiful here, isn't it?\" Says a voice behind you. You turn and see a man, clad in simple robes, behind you. This must be one of the extremists!\n\n\n\"Stay away!\" You shout, stumbling over something and hitting the ground. The man chuckles.\n\n\n\"Watch out for logs next time,\" he says, \"Come on, I'll help you up.\" He helps you to your feet.\n\n\n\"I know why you're here,\" he says, grimly, \"You want the Device. Well, if that is what you really want, I shall take you to it and you can do whatever you want with it. On the way, I shall tell you my story, the story of Birch Oak, so you will be able to make your final decision.\"\n\n\nYou walk through the woods, past things apparently called rivers and bushes, and the man, called Birch Oak, tells you his tale.\n\n\n\"When the Desire Chips were invented,\" Birch Oak explains, \"The wisest among humanity saw this as an abomination. Some thought that it interfered with our god, or gods, will, and refused to accept these chips on religious grounds. Others did not believe in gods, but still thought there was some kind of spiritual power that decided things, which we should not attempt to seperate our minds from. Still other believed in purely practical and logical arguments, that using these Chips would open up a can of worms that would ruins our minds permanently. Whatever their beliefs, all these people banded together and created their own civilisation, far away from that degenerate Hell that the City Folk had sleepwalked into. We all decided to live naturally, as was intended, far into the wilderness, and gave ourselves the name \"Woodfolk\". A few of our descendents were scientists, and they created special devices that would keep our enemies at bay. So we lived here, living simple lives and keeping our minds and our brains and our bodies free of the pollution and control of technology. But lately, the City Folk began to get more aggressive, so we decided that there was only one thing for it. We stole their Main Computer Device, and we have been trying to use it to save humanity. You see, this machine has the power to deactivate every single Chip on the planet. Humanity will return to its natural state; no longer desiring work or junk or whatever nonsense has been programmed into their brains. They will see the world as it is meant to be seen, love what they are meant to love and despise what they are meant to despise. We could not manage this, however, since the encryption was too strong...however, we know you have been sent to us with a black USB, that has been programmed only to respond to your DNA. That USB bypasses every encryption on the Device, and it will give you the option to switch the device off. Do not do this! Instead, use the option we have tried to program in - use the device to switch off every single chip on the planet!\"\n\n\n\"But that will have drastic consequences,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"Aboslutely,\" says Birch Oak, \"Humans will no longer love their jobs, certainly nowhere near as much as they do now, meaning that every civilisation will crumble. and will likely be reverted to a pre-industrial state. Everyone who wants to survive will have to re-learn the old ways; they will have to learn agriculture, or scanvenge. I do not deny that humanity will be in for a couple of rough decades, likely even a few rough centuries.\n\n\nBut if we do not do this, if we allow the Chips to run rampart, then we will have lost all hope for humanity. However, if we switch off the chips, we can pray that humanity will learn from their mistake and never, ever repeat it again. It all depends on what you value...if you think that humanity is better off with Chips in their brains that fundementally change who they are, then by all means, destroy the Device. We won't stop you; we do not allow violence against any being. However, if you disagree with this, then I urge you to switch off the Chips, and save humanity.\"\n\n\n\n\nEventually, you make it to the Woodfolk camp. There are so many people here; old people, young children and all in between. Huts made of wood surround the encampment, and a makeshift tent lies in the middle. You go into the tent, and see a small, black laptop, hooked up to some solar panels. The Computer Device, the one that can decide the fate of the whole world.\n\n\nYou have a series of options here... \n", "Woodfolk Option - Use the Device to switch off every chip on the planet": "You plug in the black USB, and when the option comes up, press \"PERMANENTLY DEPOWER ALL CHIPS - <!WARNING!> DEPOWERING OF CHIPS IS PERMANENT. THIS ACTION CANNOT BE REVERSED\". You turn to the Woodfolk, who look at you with hope in their eyes.\n\n\n\"I knew you would do the right thing!\" Says Birch Oak, \"You are always welcome to stay here, if that is your wish.\"\n\n\nWorldwide riots broke out within hours, in every city. The people who had done menial, disgusting, dangerous and downright boring jobs, who used to live every moment of their lives, were filled with a hatred and anger for them deeper than any hatred seen before, or since. The riots were extremely effective, as there were virtually no police or army forces to offer resistance. On the contrary, these forces were often the leaders of such riots. Within only a few months, all cities and hubs of civilisation were destroyed and burned to the ground. Then, the wars began. They didn't last long, but the weapons they used were unimaginable. The weakest weapons, the hydrogen bombs, were fired first, but before long countires began using more serious and advnaced weaponry against each other, and the devestation got far worse. Billions upon billions of people died in the chaos. But some survived, mostly people who lived in the wilderness, far away from any technologically. They did not yet have the knowledge of how to rebuild, but instead were one with nature. The cities began to crumble and in their place grew plants, first simple ones like vines and lianas, but eventually grass and even trees returned. The technological nightmare that the world had lived through began to fade, until they were just myths told by parents to children who played with sticks and rocks under a blue, smogless sky...\n", "Desmond's Option - Destroy the Device, keeping things running as they are": "You plug in the black USB and choose the \"Destroy the Device\" option. The screen goes blue, then shuts off for good.\n\n\nThe Woodfolk around you look shocked. Birch Oak looks to you with a sad expression on his face.\n\n\n\"You made your choice,\" he says, \"Now leave. Leave and never come back.\" You are escorted outside, and return to the van...\n\n\n \n\nYou were taken back to the Upcity, and treated like a King. The Device was destroyed, and society had been saved, but at what cost?\n\n\nThe world went on much the same, for a while. People went into their jobs, beamming and smiling all the while, not even considering the idea of enjoying anything else. Human society happened so efficientally and quickly that, pretty soon, in filled up the entire surface of the planet, and there was not a single trace of any natural habitats left. The Chips became more and more advanced until the workers became nothing more than drones who's every waking thought was filled with work and who's every dream was filled with desire for more work. The rich lived in oppulance, for a while, until they found out how to hack their own Chips, quickly and easily. They quickly discovered that the Chips could be used to simply keep their brains in an eternal state of bliss, and they sat there, doing nothing, until they died of starvation and dehydration, leaving only the workers left. Eventually, with no one left to give them orders, they had no more work, and they all died of despair. Humanity went extinct, leaving a ruined world in their wake...\n", "Follow her": "She beams.\n\n\n\"I knew you would see reason!\" The Mysterious Woman says, and walks through the doors. You follow her down a long corridor, and when you get to the end, enter a door entitled, \"STAFF ONLY\".\n\n\nYou don't know what you were expecting here, but it certianly isn't what you are seeing now. A huge, concrete room, with several hundred dirty bunk beds and mattresses lying around. Each of these beds has a different person on them, surrounded by a different object. One person is covered in discarded crisp packets, another in soda cans. Yet another seems to be surrounded by a nest of bubble gum. But one thing connects all of them...the expressions of pure joy, on thier faces. Every time they look at the items they are surrounded by, or each time one of these items rubs on their skin, they squeal in ecstatic delight.\n\n\n\"These,\" says the woman, \"Are the freest people you will ever meet in your life.\"\n", "Ask for a further explanation": "\"You know the Chips can alter desire, of course,\" The Mysterious Woman explains, \"And you know that the government and Coroporations use them to have a happy workforce. However, the \"Work Desire\" is, of course, entirely arbitrary. Since the Chip controls desire, if someone was smart enough, they could hypothetically mod, or hack, these Chips into making people desire, well, pretty much anything. I found out how to do this a while back, and now I allow anyone to do this too...for a price. These people were given the ability to desire anything they wanted, so they all just chose the most common things to give them pleasure. Imagine if, every time you saw a piece of gum on the street, you would get a rush of pleasure as powerful as the most effective drug. Or every time you touched a crisp packet it would feel like the touch of your perfect soul mate. You may have noticed I said that these were the freest people on the planet. This is because they, unlike everyone else, can decide for themselves what they wish to desire. The Workers are all slaves; the chips make them love working for their masters. Those few who do not have a Chip, such as yourself, are also slaves. You are slaves to your biological whims; when you desire food, or water, or desire someone who you find attractive, these are not your choices. These are desires that were programmed into you by nature, by your genes, that simply want you to survive long enough to breed so you can pass the genes on to the next generation. But here, people are given the option to truly choose to want whatever they want. This is what we offer here.\"\n", "Ask what she wants you to do": "\"It's simple,\" she says, \"Everyone here has had their chips altered so that, instead of desiring things like work, they will desire common things like rubbish, making them the happiest beings on the planet. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I have realised something...why should this gift go only to the most rich and the most powerful? Why not everyone? I have more than enough money here, so much that I do not even need any more. Well, I know of a certain Computer Device that can control the Chips of every single human being in the world. So I invented a program of my own-if you installed this program into the Device, then this pleasure would be available to all of them. Imagine that; a world where, everytime someone looked at a discarded chocolate bar wrapping on the pavement, their minds would be filled with the same pleasure as if they had just seen a priceless diamond in the street. So I urge you, when you find the Device, place this USB stick into it, and the world will be thrown into unending bliss.\" She gives you a black USB, and then leads you out.

Convection of heat radiates throughout this slightly vicious medium that occupies everything that is not a part of your being. As you begin to look around, you notice that your body is translucent and has no hue or color to speak of.\n\n\n     The second thing you notice is that there is a circular wall behind what you believe is your tail. You slip your tail though the vicious medium and use it to feel the wall, and when you do this, you feel that it is warmer outside of the wall than it is inside of it. With a cold chill running throughout your body you feel a need to go outside where it is warm. Grow an appendage to help you cope with this problem, or you could wait it out.

An explosion of sensation envelops you as a thinner, clearer liquid begins to fill your cage. Taking this as a good sign you bash at the wall for the last time. Instead of the wall being cast over like you would expect one to do, your entire world dissolves along with the now shattered wall. Fearing that you are dissolving along with your world you hurriedly examine yourself.\n\n\n     Looking at your see-through body you notice a pinkish tint throughout your body. Seeing that your consistency is still the same you double check each and every part just to be sure. You look at what is closest to your eye and work your way down.

After finding them some food you leave them to fend for themselves, after all 125 kids are hard to feed. If you kept them they would surely starve. Leaving the first clutch behind was the hardest thing you have ever done.\n\n\n     After the fifth clutch you still feel hurt but the pain gets lost quicker than the first ones. You and Xiranthia have many clutches after that about 103 total. while foraging one day you can't turn invisible. You have become old and you want a quick death. You swim up to a whowhatsit and go for its jaws, and with Xiranthia beside you you are for the first time unafraid.\n", "A new begining": "     Crawling out of the primordial muck came a plethora of creatures. Your oceanic ecosystem has been a constant upheaval of new species and branches on the tree of life. Your species has come a long way, but is still in the early stages of life. Life is bursting from every pore and crevice. Some creatures and plants have even scrounged out an existence above on the surface. Your species gazes in awe around them as new wonders unfold. The floor is covered in the color of plants and sponges. Creatures crawl, swim, and float everywhere they look. Even the cold, eerie, darkness below conveys a sort of euphoria. The most interesting and wonderful thing of all is what lies above...\n\n\n\n     Although it has been a long time since your species has first gazed upon this land nothing much has changed. Life expectancy has almost doubled for your species thanks to your quick and tough decisions past. Now your successors have become better suited to life. Your drive lives on in your progeny. They have spread throughout the cradle of life. A new age is about to emerge and you need to think of your species best interests. So they can carry on your spirit throughout the above and beyond. Otherwise they will wither and die out due to the problems that come with stagnation.\n\n\n     The Planet you have seen before is not the same one that is here now. Omicron has become unstable this last millennia. The singular ocean has been contorted and re-shaped as plate tectonics raise the crust up above the sea level. Rocks have been showering the oceans from above. Some of these rocks are warm, even when they meet with the cold water at the floor, and kill those who stay too close for too long. The surrounding asteroid belt around Omicron is starting to make a proto-moon. These changes have seriously hurt the life on Omicron. Life has Still thrived despite these problems taking place. For every species wiped out a hundred takes its place. Diversity and numbers have overcome the devastation.\n\n\n     Life will survive, thrive, and move on. The question is whether your species will do the same, or end up as one of the many others that have fallen before. The time of Ages has begun. Only you can advance your species throughout the Ages.\n\n\nWelcome to the start of Ages\n"}, "tree": {"Starting": {"Click To Begin": {"Use your tail to break open the wall and get out of this prison": {"Take care of the threat.": {"Death": "END"}, "Make an better attempt to describe what it is.": {"touch it.": {"use another sense": {"touch it.": {"use another sense": "END", "lick it.": "END"}, "lick it.": {"Poison isn't yummy": "END"}}}}}, "lick it.": {"Poison isn't yummy": "END"}, "look at it.": {"potato": {"eat his kill": {"Ooops I got eaten again": "END"}, "wait for his scraps": {"kill it": {"Short tempered, big fin": "END"}, "hide from it": {"no reward": "END"}, "greet it": {"continue with your mate": {"Life goes on...": "END"}}}}, "wait for his scraps": {"kill it": {"Short tempered, big fin": "END"}, "hide from it": {"no reward": "END"}, "greet it": {"continue with your mate": {"Life goes on...": {"Age of Light": "END"}}}}}}, "hide from it": {"no reward": "END"}}}}, {"title": "Eyes on a Moon of Blindness", "stories": {"A Book of Many Fates": "EYES on a\n\n\nMOON of BLINDNESS\n\n\nBill Ingersoll\n\n\n\n\nText \u00a9 2020 Bill Ingersoll / Published April 2020 / Image source: goodfon.com\n", "-i-": " \n\n \n\n         There is a sound in the calm\n\n      Someone is coming to harm\n\n   I press my hands to my ears\n\nIt's easier here just to forget fear\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 Depeche Mode\n", "-1-": "Part One: Theryl's Story\n\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n\n\"Theryl, you're going to have to make a decision sooner or later.\"\n\n\nRufus Tello is standing just outside the door to your private quarters, unshaven and gaunt. The hatch has swung wide open, but in his hesitance not even a finger dares cross the imaginary barrier that divides the corridor from your room.\n\n\n\"Let's not talk about that now,\" you say. \"This isn't the time. You know it.\"\n\n\nBut this refusal on your part just stirs a surprising streak of defiance in him. His diminished body straightens, and his face almost flushes with vigor.\n\n\n\"Oh, damn you then,\" he says. \"It was time six weeks ago. But this is your show. It's your ship that will get us out of here.\"\n\n\n\"Well then just leave! What do you need me for?\" Really, these talks have grown tiresome. You're not sure what it is he really wants from you; certainly there is more to his words than just their surface meaning.\n\n\nTello's eyes set upon you with tired impatience, like an adult forced to reason with an implacable child.\n\n\n\"It's been all I can do to keep the others from stealing the shuttle and stranding us both here,\" he says. \"Kokkinopole is a real son of a bitch; you don't need me tell you that. It's only a matter of time until he figures out the transport's thruster stabilization mechanism is hidden in my closet.\"\n\n\nYou have to stifle a laugh when you visualize the twelve-kilo lunk of greasy equipment sitting underneath a wardrobe of Tello's equally grease-stained overalls. Only he would think to disable the lunar mine's only passenger shuttle by removing a key component and stashing it in such a pathetic location.\n\n\n\"You like that, huh?\" he says. \"You should see where I put the environmental valves.\"\n\n\nYour plant manager is trying to disarm you. The bastard. Tello has worked for your family for five years, beginning the year before you inherited the mine from your father. He knows you, and especially how to get what he wants from you. Perhaps this has been the reason you have been reflexively shutting him out ever since disaster struck.\n\n\nWhen you don't respond, he continues his verbal parry. \"So what will it be? Stay here and hope nothing finds you, or come with us and get your people to safety?\"\n\n\nNow it's your turn to feel flushed. \"Rufus, you know it's not nearly that simple!\"\n\n\n\"Diden and Ihon are dead. Everybody is dead except us. Theryl, you need to think about yourself. You need to think about the people who are still left \u2014 the people you still have an opportunity to save!\"\n\n\nThe mention of your husband and son comes like a stab wound to the gut. They were down on the planet when the attack came three months ago. There has been no contact with anyone on Chaandria since the last radio signals went silent a few weeks later. Diden Ureste is not the type of man who'd go down easily; he'd have taken Ihon up into the hills, the place where he'd have the undisputed home field advantage. You have to believe that's where your family is waiting for you. They are alive, they are surviving from day to day, but under the circumstances they have no ability to contact you.\n\n\nEven so, you know Rufus Tello has your best interests at heart. Maybe you disagree with him on the details of your situation, but otherwise his assessment is correct. There is a high probability escape will be a futile enterprise anyway, but choosing to remain here on Chhota Chandrama would be tantamount to pledging yourself to a slow suicide. The question is, who do you try to lead to safety: the Crident-Ureste Extraction Corporation employees who you know are still alive, or the man and boy you need to believe are awaiting for you to rescue them?\n\n\nEither way, this is your mine; it's time to start acting like the boss you once were. Tello is correct in his insistence that you need to make your decision soon; you are correct in your rebuttal that 1130 hours is not the time to make it.\n\n\n\"I'd appreciate it if you refrain from speculating on the status of my family,\" you say. \"You know Diden just as well as I do. No overgrown grasshopper is going to beat him.\"\n\n\nTello seems appropriately chastised for suggesting otherwise. \"No, ma'am,\" he says.\n\n\n\"But I can't expect the six of you to come looking for him with me, either,\" you continue.\n\n\n\"I would.\" He sounds almost wounded, and you realize in that instant he is sincere: Rufus Tello really would join you if you chose to return to Chaandria \u2014 if you chose to venture into the heart of the hornet's nest to look for your son and husband.\n\n\n\"I couldn't let you, Rufus. That would leave Kokkinopole in charge of trying to get everyone else out of the system, and neither one of us wants that, right?\"\n\n\n\"Fair point,\" Tello says, still squared off in front of you in the corridor. His last shower was probably longer ago than his last meal, but you can't judge. You've all had to make sacrifices in the face of dwindling resources.\n\n\n\"But let me make a counterpoint,\" he continues. \"We face an enemy that seems hellbent on our extermination. This is not some rival corporation encroaching on our claim. You may be right, Diden and Ihon may be holed up in the Nabee Hills. But maybe we need the Tyuu Guard to help us on this one.\"\n\n\n\"I admire your optimism, Rufus. But I can't imagine those pink-skinned paragons of humanity getting their hands dirty looking for my husband and child.\"\n\n\n\"Theryl,\" he says, his voice dropping. \"It's not all on you.\"\n\n\nBut instead of forcing your decision he turns away without another word. You step into the open hatch to watch as he disappears around the corner, his strides long and leaping because of the light gravity.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n", "-2-": "Chaandria: the world forty-five lightyears from Old Earth where until recently twelve million Naya Gyaan believers had been busily building their new society. The colony's booming cities had once been filled with statues of Bhagavaan ke Bachche, the prophet who guided his people into space, but who was derided as vidharmee by the Old Hindu fathers from whom he was fleeing. But considering all that has happened, you have no way of knowing if those cities still stand.\n\n\nIn the twenty-seventh century the Naya Gyaan had grown into a prosperous people, their singular religious views having long been vindicated by the material successes of their culture. One of the secrets to that success was Chaandria's policy on the importation of labor. The Naya Gyaan themselves abided by strict standards of personal cleanliness, which tended to prevent them from directly exploiting their own planetary resources. Rather, they profited from the sale of mineral licenses, and let off-worlders \u2014 or Ganda as they were called, a word that meant \"dirty\" in Hindi \u2014 do all the distasteful labor.\n\n\nKnowing this detail didn't deter the non-believers from coming. Eighty years ago, your grandfather was one of them. Noah Orbrett staked a claim to a vein of ilmenite on Chaandria, from which he made his fortune extracting titanium. He married Thaldaria Winston, thus establishing your family line in a quiet village sixty kilometers from the teeming streets of Ummeed ka Shahar.\n\n\nThe name Chaandria is a derivation of the Hindi word for \"moon.\" Most people who don't speak Hindi simply refer to it as Chodry, a misspelled name that has no meaning in any language. Chaandria is not really a moon, though; it is one of two planets caught in a binary orbit with each other. It's companion in this celestial waltz is Chhota Chandrama, or the \"little moon.\" The difference in size between these two twins is slight, but nevertheless it results in a profound difference: Big Chodry is a world teeming with life, while Little Chodry is barren and retains the thinnest of toxic atmospheres.\n\n\nYour mother, Katy Orbrett, married Artor Crident, who owned a small mine of his own on Chhota Chandrama. That original site was depleted before you were even born, but Dad had claims all over Little Chodry. He was a hands-on manager, never content to collect his profits from behind a desk. Toward the end of his tenure he had hired Rufus Tello as his plant manager, but rather than simply hire someone reliable to do his job for him, Dad had in mind a more collaborative working relationship. Sadly, that was how he met his end. He had been trying to repair the Number Two drill in the northern quarry at his most recent mine when a fuel line ruptured; after his body had been identified in the wreckage of the explosion ownership of the family enterprise fell to you.\n\n\nAt that point you had been married to Diden for only three years, and Ihon was barely a year old. In a break from family tradition, you had married someone whose family had never owned a mine, nor had any interest in operating one. The Ureste name became attached to your family's business only because you had taken it as your married name; Diden Ureste, as far as you could tell, had never been to Chhota Chandrama, never held a chunk of ilmenite, nor had any concept of the manufacturing process for titanium.\n\n\nRather, he had been a staff sergeant in the Sanrakshak, the armed force that passed for a military on Chaandria. Not being a member of the Naya Gyaan, he could never hope to get a more interesting posting than the jhabbe settlements where most of the Ganda lived. He had been born in a small village near Dakshinee Shahar, the great city of the south, but the two of you had met when he had been on weekend leave in your own hometown.\n\n\n\"Is this the way to the public bath?\" he had said, stumbling up the street that everyone knew led not to the bath, but to the magistrate's house instead. You had no idea who this red-faced soldier was, and he didn't exactly present well in his unbuttoned uniform and wrinkled trousers. Clearly he was drunk. Dad liked to tip back a whiskey glass now and then, but always with dignity in the privacy of his own den. Public drunkenness was a new concept to you.\n\n\nStill, there was something unexpectedly endearing about this particular drunken mercenary. There was no mistaking the power of the body concealed under all that disheveled khaki, but the man himself seemed like someone who was on a lifelong adventure, in which his current state was just an amusing experience.\n\n\n\"I doubt Judge Pofaris will have a sense of humor about you passing out drunk in his swimming pool,\" you said.\n\n\n\"Who said I'm drunk?\" Diden said. \"I just don't want to return to the barracks smelling like booze.\"\n\n\n\"Well in that case you might want to do an about-face, soldier. If you came from the Hotel Loomix, you walked right past the public bathhouse.\"\n\n\n\"What a knowledgeable young lady. I appreciate you setting me straight.\" He turned, but in the wrong direction. You had to catch him by the elbow to prevent him from taking the main road back into the city.\n\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better if I took you there,\" you said.\n\n\n\"That's not necessary. I'm sure I can find it.\"\n\n\n\"I'm sure you can. Let me take you anyway.\"\n\n\nExcept the two of you never made it to the bathhouse as planned. Instead, Diden was able to walk no farther than the park, where you sat him down on a bench. His face muscles had gone lax under the influence of the alcohol, but your eyes saw past his current state to the attractive man you knew he must be.\n\n\n\"You aren't just going to abandon me here, are you?\" There was great concern in his voice.\n\n\nThat had been your original thought, yes, but the implied plea for you to stay moved you. And so you remained on the bench well into the night, neither of you leaving until Diden had recovered enough to make the trip back to his command.\n\n\nWhen the two of you married, he still had a year remaining on his commitment to the Sanrakshak \u2014 but once Ihon was born, he lost all interest in reenlisting. The baby looked very much like him: the same hazel eyes, almost identical attached earlobes. The wisp of light hair was the most obvious bit of heredity traceable to you. The three of you were prepared to settle right there in town, with you working in the local business office for Crident Extraction, but then word came of Dad's death. Since then, you have spent most of your time on Chhota Chandrama, directly supervising the mine's operation.\n\n\n \n\nThat's where you were the day three months ago when the invasion fleet appeared. The ships had come from somewhere in deep space, beyond the limited reach of human space travel. The children of Earth, dispersed like dandelion seeds as civilization nearly collapsed in the twenty-second century, had been slowly building a mastery of interstellar travel. But even with the advent of the new Hoshino Drives, the best ships and boldest missions had never made it more than eighty lightyears from Old Earth. Although a number of habitable planets had been found \u2014 Chaandria, Kaitoo, Usul, Tyuu, and nine others \u2014 no other sentient species had been contacted. As far as anyone knew, the universe was a cold and dumb place: occasionally capable of producing a green rock, but not anyone else for humans to talk to. Thus the exploration of space fostered an explosion in the growth of new religious sects such as the Naya Gyaan, since no one had yet found evidence that humans weren't the result of a special act of creation.\n\n\nThe newcomers eliminated that conceit as they set about exterminating the Naya Gyaan, as well as everyone living on Chaandria. They didn't even bother introducing themselves; their bizarre ships, no two of them alike, surrounded Big Chodry and descended en masse. From the mine on Little Chodry, you and your crew listened to the wireless traffic as the Sanrakshak forces announced in exasperated tones that poisonous gases were being released into Chaandria's atmosphere, swiftly killing the populations of entire cities without destroying a single bit of infrastructure. No amount of weaponry could defend against such warfare. Government transmissions ended after a few days, leaving only the desperate pleas from increasingly isolated groups. It was unclear what exactly was going on, except that the planet was being overrun by a race of people that resembled locusts in both bodily form and swarm-like action.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, during humanity's infancy on Earth, insects had brought plague and pestilence to farms and cities alike. Then people became clever and learned how to control insect populations by chemical means, thus reasserting mastery over the planet. From what you and your company employees could determine from your refuge on Chhota Chandrama, the insects had now come to exact their revenge by employing the same strategy: gassing the entire planet for the purpose of exterminating the human population in the shortest time possible.\n\n\nAll you could do was watch in horror. The alien menace seemed to have no idea you were there, or they didn't seem to care. Little Chodry was uninhabitable without pressure domes and hydroponics, and thus you theorized the invaders only valued the larger world, the one with oceans and ecosystems. As human transmissions ceased altogether, their hive-like ships continued to arrive, carrying more of their kind to populate the newly conquered world.\n\n\nYou could intercept the alien transmissions as well, although listening to it gave you no insight. The pulsating, high-pitched language was grating on the nerves of everyone marooned at the mine complex with you. It was Rufus Tello who came up with a name for them one day.\n\n\n\"I swear,\" he said as you and your entire planetary workforce of six people gathered around the radio in the main office, \"I keep hearing the same thing over and over again: eeb cheeb, eeb cheeb, eeb cheeb, eeb cheeb, eeb cheeb, like crickets chirping on a summer night. I don't see how anyone could make out any words in a noise like that.\"\n\n\nAnd thus you came to call the conquerors the Iib Ch'iib, because you had to call them something. The communication equipment you had available at the mine could send a signal no farther than Chaandria, just 300 thousand kilometers away. Even if there were still humans there, you didn't dare try and contact them, lest the Iib Ch'iib trace the transmission back to you. The next nearest human-settled world was Tyuu, thirteen lightyears away; there was no way to send a signal that far without a hyperspace comm system, which was far too expensive for a mining outfit like yours.\n\n\nTherefore even though the Iib Ch'iib hadn't assaulted Little Chodry, you felt as though you were trapped there. Send a call for help, and the giant insects would find you. But you also feared that if you launched a ship in a bid to escape, the Iib Ch'iib would almost certainly notice that too. Therefore you and your employees have been holed up ever since the invasion, living like scared rabbits waiting for a hawk to pass. Meanwhile, the mine's supplies are dwindling.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n", "-3-": "The next morning, you find Thyos Kokkinopole and Cosmo Hamaritus in the company break room. This used to be a place of levity, where the members of your workforce would come to momentarily escape equipment breakdowns and order fulfillment. Now your skin crawls at the thought of the two most malcontented people on Chhota Chandrama.\n\n\nYou can hear Kokkinopole's voice all the way down the hallway. In this 0.48-G environment even a gentle step could send you bounding down the corridor, so it takes tremendous self-control to merely creep closer to the entrance to the room. If only Dad had installed handrails. You know that if you burst into the room, they will likely change the conversation or stop talking altogether. Kokkinopole never says anything to you directly anymore except to bitch and complain, so you recognize an opportunity to hear his thoughts unedited and unfiltered.\n\n\n\"Men weren't meant to live like this,\" Kokkinopole is saying.\n\n\n\"I hear you, brother,\" Hamaritus responds.\n\n\n\"And I didn't sign up for this bullshit. I came here to make money. I don't give a rat's ass what happens on some planet full of towel-heads. I have a family back on Kaitoo that depends on the deposits I transmit to them.\"\n\n\n\"Same here, same here.\"\n\n\n\"This place hasn't produced a gram of titanium since the attack. We've been sitting idle for three months. And our Boss Lady won't let us leave \u2014 too afraid to stay, too afraid to go.\"\n\n\n\"So long as Tello's got her back, there's not much we can do about it.\"\n\n\n\"We'll see, Cosmo. We'll see.\"\n\n\nBy that point you have reached the entrance to the break room, so there is no point in hiding. You turn the corner, finding only the two occupants. Both men look up when you enter, and both make eye contact. But then both return to their conversation.\n\n\n\"Now the Old Man, there was a great boss,\" Kokkinopole says. \"Artor Crident knew how to take care of his people. I was just a drill operator when he took me on twelve years ago, before he put me in charge of the machine shop. We made money hand over fist back when he was alive.\"\n\n\n\"This place is lucky to have you, brother,\" his sidekick Hamaritus says. \"Most outfits would probably pay you twice what you make here.\"\n\n\nYou go about making your breakfast, allotting yourself just a pathetic amount of the remaining powdered egg mass. There may only be a couple weeks' worth of food left in the company stores, and only if everyone rations their usage. Not surprisingly, you noticed that both Kokkinopole and Hamaritus had helped themselves to generous portions before you arrived; both still have plenty of uneaten synth-egg on their plates.\n\n\n\"No need to tell me,\" Kokkinopole says. \"I know what I'm worth.\"\n\n\nIt's like listening to a well-rehearsed skit, scripted and performed for your benefit. For all the bragging that he does, your machinist sure has mastered the art of passive-aggression. It's almost comical in a way, because back in your office you have an employee file 5 GB in size devoted to this character, courtesy of your father's diligent background check and subsequent record-keeping: Thyos Kokkinopole, aged 45, not currently married, owes child support to two different women, neither one living on Kaitoo now or in the past. There is an indication of a criminal record on that planet, although that portion of the file is encrypted and unreadable. Fired from his last three jobs, hired by Dad only after agreeing to a significant pay reduction; assigned to the machinist position only because he sucked at operating a mining drill.\n\n\nTherefore you, too, know exactly what this arrogant airbag is worth, perhaps more accurately than he thinks. The question, then, is whether to confront him or ignore him.\n\n\nYou decide to confront, if only for the entertainment value.\n\n\n\"Mr. Kokkinopole, Mr. Hamaritus. Good morning,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Mrs. Ureste. You are looking fine,\" Kokkinopole says. \"Heard from your husband lately?\"\n\n\nHamaritus loses control and laughs at the joke, practically spraying the table.\n\n\n\"Careful there, brother,\" Kokkinopole says. \"That's my breakfast you just contaminated.\"\n\n\n\"I can't help but notice that's an awfully large breakfast, Thyos,\" you say. \"Are you going to finish all that?\"\n\n\n\"I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach, Ma'am.\"\n\n\nMa'am. Cripes, you're not even thirty yet. \"You do realize we're completely cut off, and that we're running low on supplies, right? I've explained the need to ration.\"\n\n\n\"It's not ringing a bell. Maybe you should explain to us again what we're all still doing here.\"\n\n\nThe Reconstituter dings when your synthesized scrambled eggs are ready. You take the hot plate to their table and sit down, hoping that you are showing no sign of intimidation.\n\n\n\"You are optimistic in our chances of sneaking past the Iib Ch'iib armada, Thyos?\" you say.\n\n\n\"I give us better odds than if we stayed here,\" Kokkinopole says, a bit of egg snared in his brown beard.\n\n\n\"The system has been swarming with hive ships. That doesn't impress you?\"\n\n\n\"They aren't looking for us. They'll never notice.\"\n\n\n\"And if they do?\"\n\n\n\"Gods, woman, grow a pair of\u2026. Look, it's a simple process of elimination. Can we stay here? Not unless we can learn how to eat rock. Is there anything for us on Chodry? I wouldn't know, because I can't speak cricket.\"\n\n\nCosmo, who has been watching from the sidelines, cracks himself up with laughter again. \"Maybe we should give Diden a call. I bet he's fluent in 'cricketese' by now!\"\n\n\nKokkinopole laughs so hard his belly heaves with convulsions. \"Maybe he can broker a supply run for us. Cheeb cheeb cheeb cheeb cheeb!\"\n\n\nYou can't afford to let these bastards under your skin. \"You were saying, Thyos?\"\n\n\n\"What? Oh yes, the process of elimination. We can't stay, we can't return to base, so what does that leave?\"\n\n\n\"We need to get the flock out of here, is what it means,\" Hamaritus says.\n\n\n\"Right. And we need to do it now,\" Kokkinopole says.\n\n\nIt's time to shock them both. \"I agree, we need to leave.\"\n\n\n\"No need to thank me for being right,\" the machinist says.\n\n\n\"I told Mr. Tello first thing this morning. He's preparing the transport as we speak. If you fat slobs weren't in here stuffing your face, you might've been down there helping him.\"\n\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\n\"Better get packing.\"\n\n\nBoth men quickly rise from their seats, with Hamaritus stuffing the last of his eggs in his mouth. \"Say no more, Ma'am,\" Kokkinopole says. \"We're on it. This is the first reasonable thing I've heard in a long time. Come on, brother, let's go see Rufus. I was packed weeks ago.\"\n\n\nThe two grown men look silly bounding out of the room, sped along by the low gravity. But they leave their dirty plates behind them on the table, as if it were your job as the only woman in the room to clean up after them. Screw it; let the Iib Ch'iib deal with the dishes, if they ever find this place.\n\n\nWith the break room now empty of testosterone, you can finish your synth-eggs in peace. Yes, it's true that you decided early this morning, while sleep was eluding you, that you needed to abandon the mine and allow your people to try and seek safety. The only reason you had hesitated this long was because of all the Iib Ch'iib traffic surrounding the two planets. Instead of declining, the amount of dun-colored vessels has only been climbing. This probably means that the optimal time to sneak past the alien fleet had passed weeks ago, and that waiting any longer would only make the odds worse.\n\n\nSo much for your six employees. What about you? This is where you feel split to your core. The rational course would be to join your crew on the transport and try and escape to Tyuu, despite the high likelihood of getting shot down by the Iib Ch'iib.\n\n\nBut that would mean abandoning Diden and Ihon, your lover and your baby boy, who for all you know are living in fear down on Big Chodry. If not for you, they will have no other hope of salvation. There are two cargo haulers here at the mine, small pods intended to pull containers full of materials and equipment. On its own, without being hooked up to a boxy freighter, either one of these pods might be small enough to make it to the planet's surface undetected. The invaders may very well dismiss the pod as a chunk of falling debris.\n\n\nThere really is no option here, is there? You know exactly what you need to do.\n\n\n \n\nThe personnel transport is located just outside the mine's main residential habitat, and that's where the six employees of Crident-Ureste Extraction should be gathering. The cargo pods, however, are sitting under a pressurized dome adjacent to the mine's largest quarry pit. A hundred-meter tunnel connects the living habitat with the excavation area, and you realize as you pack the few items you think you'll need from your quarters \u2014 mostly just a few extra clothes, a literjon of water, what few non-perishable rations you've managed to set aside \u2014 that you are not about to just leave a place, but abandoning all that Dad worked for. This is what makes it hard to leave. This is what rabble like Thyos Kokkinopole will never understand.\n\n\nSpeaking of Dad. He was a pragmatic sort, always looking for solutions to problems, or preferably avoiding them in the first place. He was never one to court trouble, but he was smart enough to know that trouble might come to him anyway. Therefore he kept a plasgun in his quarters here at the mine, knowing that this was a remote location far from the protective aegis of the Sanrakshak. Raiders, thieves, claim jumpers, or disgruntled employees might all pay a visit without invitation, and the nearest military outpost on Chhota Chandrama was in a completely different hemisphere. Best, then, that even a non-violent man be prepared to protect himself.\n\n\nDad's old quarters are right next to yours, and they are just the way he left the place: unmade bed, dirty laundry in a hamper, a reading pad on the stand next to his bed, the alarm perpetually set to 0500 hours. You were going to clean this place out in the aftermath of his funeral, but there was no need to clear out the room to make space for someone else, and it was hard to imagine anybody wanting any of this inconsequential stuff. Anything of real value was back on Chaandria. So you had left the room just as he did.\n\n\nHow odd to be back now, then. The hatch swings open, and the room light snaps on. Millimeters of dust cover the dresser and the arms of a chair. The bed looks like Dad slept here just last night. He kept the plasgun in a compartment built into the headboard of his bed, just to the right of his pillow. You slide open the door and almost lose your breath: there, next to the old plasgun, is a photo of the two of you, taken on your wedding day. You so young, your eyes bright and without care; him so stately, a successful businessman proud of his only daughter. Your own copy of this photo is buried in an album somewhere back home.\n\n\nYou take the photo along with the plasgun. It will serve no practical purpose, but then not everything needs to justify its existence. Taking the items back to your own room, you decide to also add a photo of you, Diden, and Ihon to your over-stuffed bag. These are the important people, after all: your stunningly attractive husband, his piercing eyes, sharp features, expertly trimmed hair, and between you the chubby son, then only seven months old, the two of you had jointly created.\n\n\nThe plasgun, to your dismay, has lost much of its charge; the display shows only three green bars out of a total of eight. These things are supposed to be recharged periodically, but it has been sitting unused inside the headboard all these years. Who knows when Dad last charged it before he passed.\n\n\nIt only took minutes to pack your bag, but when you sling it over your shoulder the weight is surprising, even adjusting for Little Chodry's slight gravity. That's it, there's no more reason to linger. Best to get out of here. The romantic in you wants to linger in all the memories of the place, but the realist overrides that choice. You pull the hatch closed behind you and bound down the corridor toward the tunnel leading toward the mine.\n\n\n \n\n\"And just where do you think you are going?\"\n\n\nYou stop just before the entrance to the tunnel at the sound of Rufus Tello's voice. Turning, you see him at the bottom of a ladder leading down from the upper level.\n\n\n\"Shouldn't you be prepping the transport for departure?\" you counter.\n\n\n\"Don't need to. Thanks to you, our friend Kokkinopole has taken over that operation.\"\n\n\n\"Then you guys need to get out of here as soon as possible. Do you have a plan for evading the Iib Ch'iib fleet?\"\n\n\n\"Ideas, maybe,\" Tello says, \"but it's not like I'm a tactical pilot. We're going to be making this one up as we go along.\"\n\n\n\"I'd recommend keeping low over the surface of Chhota Chandrama until you're on the exact opposite side of the planet from Chaandria. Then fly away as fast as possible, keeping the little moon between you and the big one.\"\n\n\n\"Sounds like you've given this some thought, Theryl.\"\n\n\n\"It's part of being a leader. You always have to be thinking several steps ahead.\"\n\n\nTello steps toward you and fingers the canvas bag slung over your shoulder. \"I see. And I can't help but notice you're packed and heading in the wrong direction. You're not getting on the transport, are you?\"\n\n\n\"Rufus, I can't,\" you say. \"I could never live with myself knowing what I left behind.\"\n\n\n\"You really think they might still be alive down there? That it's worth risking everything on the worst possible odds?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, I really do think there is a possibility Diden and Ihon are still down there. And that's all that really matters.\"\n\n\nYour former plant manager seems upset by your decision.\n\n\n\"Look, Rufus, you've been an invaluable asset for both me and my father,\" you say. \"I wish you the best in whatever lies ahead for you.\"\n\n\n\"Let me come with you.\"\n\n\nThe request catches you off guard. It's not the first time he hinted at this possibility, but then no one was actually leaving anywhere. Now that the moment has come, his insistence seems unexpected.\n\n\n\"Come with me? Why?\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\n\"Well, for one thing, this will probably be a one-way trip,\" you say. \"Even if I do manage to make it to the planet's surface, even if I do find my family, I doubt the Iib Ch'iib will just let us fly away.\"\n\n\n\"All the more reason not to go alone,\" he says.\n\n\n\"I don't understand. Don't you have people of your own to get back to?\"\n\n\nTello shrugs his shoulders. \"I took this job partly because not many other people applied for it. This place is so remote that people with family attachments wouldn't see the appeal. That was never an issue for me.\"\n\n\nIt strikes you that until this moment you had never given much thought to his background. During the years that he had been here, Rufus Tello had been so reliable, so constant that you never had cause to look up his employee files or to ponder where he had come from. He was a presence you had taken for granted.\n\n\nNow there is a vulnerability in his composure, something that might have been there all along but which you are only noticing now for the first time. He is concerned about you, in a way that goes beyond a plant manager's concern for the person who owns the company.\n\n\n\"If you came with me, how would that affect the odds of the others getting away on the transport?\"\n\n\n\"We discussed this, remember?\" he says. \"I know you don't think too highly of him, but my money is on Kokkinopole's sense of self-preservation any day.\"\n\n\n\"You're serious, aren't you?\"\n\n\n\"Look, it's up to you. If you don't want me, then you don't want me. But I've got no one to run to. Whether I go to Tyuu, or whether I go to Chaandria, it's all the same to me.\"\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n", "-4-": "\"Well, then,\" you say. \"Do you need me to wait while you go get your things?\"\n\n\nTello looks unusually relieved that you're letting him come with you. \"I didn't really pack anything. But I should go back up and let Kokkinopole know.\"\n\n\n\"No, don't,\" you say.\n\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\n\"Let him focus on getting the transport operational. I assume you returned all the parts you had hiding in your quarters?\"\n\n\n\"Returned and reinstalled, yes.\"\n\n\n\"Then I don't feel I owe Kokkinopole anything. We'll radio the transport once we're ready ourselves.\"\n\n\n\"In that case, I'll follow you,\" Tello says.\n\n\nAnd so you lead the way down the tunnel to the mine. The passageway is a glass-walled tube that had been the everyday pedestrian connection between the drilling operations and the residential habitat, back when this was still a functioning business, right up until the day of the attack. The tunnel sits on Chhota Chandrama's barren surface, with the palest of skies overhead; even in the full light of day a few bright stars can be seen through the skimpy atmosphere. The Number One pit sits like a giant grave in the bedrock, big enough to entomb a mythical Titan if necessary. The tunnel brings you to the foot of that grave, where a second set of habitat structures houses the industrial side of the mine complex.\n\n\nThe trek to the cargo pods takes you past a wall of lockers where your employees once suited up for their day's work. Several of the units have since been emptied, their doors swung open to reveal dark interiors.\n\n\n\"Hold on one moment, OK?\" Tello says. He approaches one of the lockers that is still sealed shut and presses his palm on the ID pad. The locking mechanism beeps and the door swings open.\n\n\n\"I may have been the manager of this operation, but I will always be a mechanic at heart,\" he explains. \"I guess if I own anything of value in this whole place, it would be these.\" He pulls out a tool belt loaded with an array of gadgets, some familiar, most not. Each item looks dingy and ancient.\n\n\n\"In case the cargo pod breaks down?\" you say.\n\n\n\"Sure. Maybe.\"\n\n\nYou need to take a service lift up to the dome where the two cargo pods are stored. The platform is as big as a theater stage, built to accommodate not just people but huge containers of ore. By design, it rises slowly to the upper level. Impatient, you hop off the lift a meter before it pulls even with the deck plating, taking advantage of the slight gravity.\n\n\n\"Which pod do you recommend using?\" you ask. Both are parked neatly in the hangar, with their angular and scratched hulls. Pod A is striped yellow and black, while Pod B is red and black. Dad bought both at an auction twelve years ago, and it had been Cosmo Hamaritus's job to pilot them and keep them in good repair.\n\n\n\"So to be clear,\" Tello says, \"your plan is to take one of these down to the planet's surface, hoping it will be too small to be noticed?\"\n\n\n\"Pretty much, yes.\"\n\n\n\"Then I'd feel safer in Pod B. Hamaritus always preferred Pod A, but you never saw how roughly he used to handle it.\"\n\n\nAnd so you climb up into the cab of Pod B, which you now realize has fewer blemishes than its twin. There are only two seats, neither very spacious. Never have you been in a spacecraft with so few creature comforts. Your canvas bag barely fits in the space behind the seat. Tello climbs in the opposite side, dropping his tool belt beside your bag. He watches with silent interest as you pull out the plasgun, storing it in a more accessible location in a compartment between the seats.\n\n\n\"I get the strong sense you already know how to fly this thing,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Dad used to let me train for my pilot's license in Pod A,\" you say. \"If you're not carrying a load, there's not much to learn.\"\n\n\nBefore you fire up the engines and the antigrav lift, you raise the personnel transport on the radio.\n\n\n\"Kokkinopole here. Who's this?\"\n\n\n\"Is the shuttle ready to go?\"\n\n\n\"Ma'am! We're just waiting on you.\"\n\n\n\"No need. I'm in Cargo Pod B. I won't be joining you.\"\n\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\"Never mind. Just get everyone on board and get yourselves out of the system. I'd give you instructions but I know you wouldn't listen anyway.\"\n\n\n\"Um, OK. If that's what you want. Do you know where that plant manager of yours got himself off to?\"\n\n\nYou look to the passenger next to you. \"Mr. Tello will be coming with me.\" You can imagine Kokkinopole's salacious imagination becoming piqued by that particular development, so you push forward. \"Never mind about us or where we're going. Just focus on what you need to do. Get that shuttle out of this system.\"\n\n\n\"OK, but\u2014\"\n\n\nTello reaches over and switches off the radio. \"Don't feed the troll. He knows what he needs to do, and he's probably relieved that neither of us will be giving him orders anymore.\"\n\n\nThe pod's controls all have a greasy residue on them, as if Hamaritus had been in the habit of eating while he flew. And when you seal the hatches, you realize that you have trapped yourselves inside a cramped compartment along with a foul but undefinable odor. But the craft hums to life with no complaints, and Tello activates the device that depressurizes the hangar and opens the outer door.\n\n\nYes, you flew one of these before, but you were eighteen at the time \u2014 a full decade ago. You had forgotten how sensitive the controls are. The pod bursts out of the hangar a little too swiftly, and you see your companion gripping the safety handle beside him. This little ship was designed to move many tons of cargo; when it is unfettered, it has thrust to spare.\n\n\nThe pod moves so fast that there is no time for a last look at the mine, or to see the transport take off on its own trajectory. It speeds forward like an aerial greyhound.\n\n\nThe surface of Chhota Chandrama is pitted and furrowed, both by natural forces and by all of the prospecting that has occurred here over the decades. You fly low over the surface until its larger sibling, Chaandria, rises over the horizon before you.\n\n\n\"At this rate we should be there in five minutes,\" Tello quips from the passenger seat.\n\n\n\"I had forgotten how much fun these things can be to fly,\" you say.\n\n\n\"This is my first time riding in one.\"\n\n\n\"Are you doing OK over there? Would you like me to ease off the thrust a little bit?\" You give him a quick look-over, but he doesn't look too pale with fright.\n\n\n\"No complaints here,\" is all he says.\n\n\nThe flight path to Big Chodry takes you for many miles over the surface of Little Chodry. There are dozens of other mines scattered over the planet, but none are nearby; all that you can see below you is an uninhabited landscape.\n\n\n\"I was thinking,\" your passenger says a moment later. \"If you're not in a big hurry, there is a place we could stop first.\"\n\n\n\"Stop? Where?\"\n\n\n\"There is a military post on Chhota Chandrama, right?\"\n\n\nHe's referring to the Sanrakshak outpost, Satark Najaren. \"Practically on the far side of the planet, yes.\"\n\n\n\"Well if the Iib Ch'iib haven't focused their attention on this world yet, it might still be there.\"\n\n\n\"It might be,\" you say.\n\n\n\"And there might still be troops there, or there might not be,\" he continues. \"But I'd wager it would be worth paying a visit, either way.\"\n\n\n\"Fuel might be an issue,\" you say. And that's true: these cargo haulers weren't intended for scenic side trips. They go from A to B, and after taking on a new load they go back from B to A. Of course, not having a load did change that calculation a bit. Still, Satark Najaren would be quite the detour.\n\n\n\"It might be, yes,\" Tello says. \"It was just a thought.\"\n\n\nAn intriguing thought, you must admit. If there were still Sanrakshak posted there, it would be the first humans you had seen in three months. They would certainly have information to share, but if they figured out your intentions they may prevent you from leaving \u2014 meaning you'd be stuck on Chhota Chandrama after all.\n\n\nOr maybe the outpost was destroyed, and the site is now crawling with Iib Ch'iib.\n\n\nThere are just too many unknowns. Perhaps it's best to stick with your original plan and fly straight to Chaandria.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n", "-10-": "Even with the speed of an unladen cargo hauler, and despite the planet's relatively small diameter, it takes hours to reach Satark Najaren. The time passes tensely, as you have no way of knowing for sure who might be monitoring air traffic on Little Chodry. Perhaps you are already signaling your presence to the enemy, putting your entire enterprise at risk. And at a more basic level, the cab of this pod is not a desirable place to spend such a long flight: not only is the space quite confining, but it lacks such the basic amenity of a toilet.\n\n\nNeither of you have ever been to Satark Najaren, so you are dependent on Tello to be your navigator. He finds the outpost's coordinates in an on-board database and feeds you the course headings. It is not a straight shot to get there, because several massive mountain ranges stand in the way.\n\n\nBut as you approach the base, the lack of radio chatter is concerning. Given the circumstances, it probably does make sense the Sanrakshak would be maintaining radio silence if they were still present, the same way you did back at the mine. Nevertheless, it seems wrong to be entering a controlled airspace without being challenged.\n\n\nIt is dusk on this part of the planet, but still light enough to make out details on the landscape. Tello has given up with the pod's limited scanners and is trying to assess the status of the base with his own eyes.\n\n\n\"The structure looks intact,\" he says. \"But I don't see any signs of movement. No patrol ships, nothing.\"\n\n\n\"But no hive ships, either,\" you observe.\n\n\n\"So what do you think? Either they're in hiding, or they abandoned the place.\"\n\n\n\"Or they were just gassed out, like everyone on Chaandria.\"\n\n\nIt's far from a pleasant thought, and Tello goes back to silently scanning the landscape through the window.\n\n\n\"I'm going to circle around the base,\" you say. \"Let me know if you see a good place to land.\"\n\n\n\"Roger that.\"\n\n\nYour companion seems like a different person now, well out of his element as a plant manager, a person with a tendency to see people as machines and machines as people. There is a certain childishness in the way he is craning his body to look through the pod's windows, saying \"roger that\" with a schoolboy's understanding of military jargon. It's kind of charming, actually.\n\n\nOne of you has to focus on flying the pod, however. You settle into a clockwise circuit of the outpost, tipping the pod to starboard so that Tello will have a better view.\n\n\n\"Do you see anything?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Not much. But then I don't know how the place operates. They might just all be hunkered down inside.\"\n\n\n\"Is there a good place to land?\"\n\n\n\"Are we sure we still want to? I admit this was my idea, but now that we're here I'm getting a bad feeling.\"\n\n\n\"I'm going to be brutally honest with you, Rufus. I've had to pee for the last hour and a half. If I don't set this thing down, it's not going to be pretty in here. And this pod already smells bad.\"\n\n\nTello turns to look at you, but then thinks better of responding. Smart man.\n\n\n\"OK, I see it,\" he finally says as your circuit of the base comes nearly to a close. \"There is a landing pad under a radiation canopy. Not pressurized, but there are breathing masks behind these seats. Otherwise, this looks like a low-security place. Doors and windows everywhere.\"\n\n\nYou take your eyes off the controls long enough to see where he's looking, and then begin a second circuit around the base. This time you lose elevation and decrease your speed, so that the next time you reach the landing pad you are able to bring the pod down for a landing under the canopy. The first thing you notice is the fact that the handful of small patrol ships parked here all look damaged, as if intentionally sabotaged. Each one bears a burn hole through the hull, carefully placed so as not to rupture a fuel line but to ensure the interior will never again hold a pressurized atmosphere.\n\n\n\"If you don't mind, let me go out first,\" he says. \"My guess is we'll find out pretty quickly if anyone's here.\"\n\n\n\"Just remember my needs,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got it.\"\n\n\nHe fishes behind the seats and pulls out the breathing apparatuses. This is Mark II equipment, really not intended for prolonged exposure on a place as inhospitable as Chhota Chandrama's surface, but it will be good enough to keep you alive for about fifteen minutes. Better hope there is an easy way to get inside that base.\n\n\nWith the mask fitted snugly over your face, Tello depressurizes the cabin and opens the hatch on his side of the pod. \"Here, take this,\" you say, handing him the plasgun.\n\n\n\"Thanks. I'll be right back.\"\n\n\nYou watch as he follows a catwalk leading from the landing pad toward the main building, where there is an airlock serving as an entrance. Being a military post, there is a good chance the thing will be locked \u2014 in which case, this whole stop may be for nought. Tello fiddles with the control panel, and then immediately gives you a thumbs-up. The airlock is functional, the interior of the base is pressurized.\n\n\nAfter hopping down from the pilot's seat, you join Tello by the entrance to the airlock. The last person to pass through must have been entering the building, because it takes a moment for the chamber to depressurize before you can enter. A red indicator light turns green, and the hatch opens. The two of you enter the airlock.\n\n\nIt is a relief to feel the air pressure building up around your exposed body. Tello removes his mask, and you do the same. Still holding the plasgun, he opens the inner hatch and leads the way inside Satark Najaren.\n\n\nYou are standing at the entrance to what looks like a mess hall: lots of tables and chairs, but not a single person anywhere. Everything looks orderly, with no signs of struggle or damage.\n\n\n\"I think what you're looking for is over there,\" Tello says. He points to the right, at the entrance to a women's lavatory. And not a moment too soon, either.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n"}, "tree": {"A Book of Many Fates": {"BEGIN": {"Next page.": {"Next page.": {"Next page.": {"Let Tello come with you.": {"Fly to Satark Najaren first.": {"Next page.": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Ground Zero", "stories": {"The First Page": "Click.\n\n\u201c\u2026well I still say a compromise can be achieved if we all just sat down and talked things out.

Everyone makes sure to stay away from windows.\n\nEven though you attempt to enjoy yourself, you still have a nagging bit of \u201cconcern\u201d for what lies ahead in the future and just can\u2019t quite loosen up completely; you\u2019re about the only one who still bothers to keep up on current events by watching TV and looking at the internet in between non-stop merrymaking. Eventually one of your co-workers Greg walks in on you watching the news by yourself. He\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019d consider a friend, but he\u2019s an acquaintance you normally talked to when you actually did work.\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ man! There\u2019s a non-stop party going on and you\u2019re in here wasting time watching TV?\u201d Greg says holding a bottle of beer.\n\u201cI just want to see if the situation has improved\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? It ain\u2019t improving man! The world\u2019s going to hell in a hand basket, and the sooner you accept that fact the better! Why don\u2019t you go talk to Marina in accounting, didn\u2019t you always have a crush on her or something?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut? But nothing man! There ain\u2019t no time left anymore! Hell I haven\u2019t seen you participate in ONE orgy since you\u2019ve been here!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, seems unsanitary, I don\u2019t want to catch something, and I don\u2019t want everyone to see me naked.\u201d\n\nGreg puts one of his hands on his face and shakes his head in disbelief of your answer. He then throws his beer bottle into the TV screen breaking them both.\n\n\u201cWAKE THE FUCK UP! This is fuckin\u2019 it man! There ain\u2019t nothing coming after this! We\u2019re all gonna die in a fiery nuclear explosion! You think it\u2019s really gonna matter if in the off chance that you do catch AIDS or some shit, you\u2019ll be alive long enough to die from it? And nobody gives a shit about how small your dick is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHEY! My dick isn\u2019t small! Its average length for someone of my height!\u201d you protest.\n\u201cWhatever man! Look what I\u2019m trying to say is, everyone is just here to have a good time and grab some pleasure before the nukes start flying, and nobody\u2019s even caring about looks right now. Shit, that fat troll Phil must be getting more action now than he ever has in his entire life! You thought Phil was disgusting looking with his clothes on, he ain\u2019t any prettier with his clothes off, and yet he has banged Kate no less than ten times since we started this Armageddon party and you know how fucking fine she is!\u201d\n\u201cReally? Phil?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you man, you NEED to go talk to Marina and get you some of that before the bombs start dropping!\u201d\n\nGreg sees that you\u2019re still a little apprehensive about the idea.\n\n\u201cFine then, or don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter to me man. I\u2019m going back to the party, I\u2019m not gonna stand here wasting my time talking to you when I could be fucking Kate. I just hope I can get to her before Phil this time.\u201d\n\nGreg leaves you to ponder the situation.\n", "Party like its 1999 (Even though it really is not 1999)": "Greg\u2019s right. This IS it! This is no time to be playing it safe! The world is going to end any day and damn it you\u2019re going to fucking LIVE life for the first time! You immediately get up and make your way to the main office area; it looks like you\u2019re just in time for another orgy. Greg is getting ready to stick it to Kate just like he said\u2026that is until you smash the back of his head in with a stapler until he\u2019s bloody and unconscious\u2026or dead. You\u2019re not sure and you don\u2019t really care anymore.\n\n\u201cYou were right\u2026man.\u201d You say breathing hard.\n\nYour actions cause people to stop in shock, then you grab Kate who\u2019s completely naked and worried about what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\n\u201cCome here you little fucking whore, you like being a fucking fuck slut? I\u2019ll treat you like one then!\u201d you utter viciously.\n\nYou proceed to bend Kate over the copy machine, pull her hair and fuck the hell out of her calling her every derogatory name in the book. The weird thing is she starts to like it. She even starts taunting you back saying you can\u2019t fuck worth a shit. This of course only makes you slap her around a bit more. You both are really getting into it.\n\nAfter watching this spontaneous act of S&M/Rape everyone goes back to doing what they were doing. From then on in, Kate hangs around you a lot more (Much to Phil\u2019s dismay) and you forget all about Marina, in fact you don\u2019t even see her in the whole time during this Armageddon party. You indulge in carnal delights like you never had before.\n\nUntil one day\u2026\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up from the floor; Kate\u2019s lying beside you asleep. There are sleeping naked bodies everywhere. Yesterday\u2019s orgy was a dozy, someone broke open a couple bags of coke they\u2019d been saving and everyone had a snort. Can\u2019t say you liked it though, your head fucking hurts, you keep hearing a fucking ring\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u2026.\u201d\n\nThen you realize it\u2019s not in your head, it\u2019s an actual ring from another TV that was left on. There\u2019s a test pattern on it.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou put your clothes back on and give Kate a quick kiss, which causes her to smile a little in her sleep. You wonder if you would\u2019ve actually had a shot with her if things had been normal, oh well you guess you\u2019ll never know.\n\nYou quietly make your way through the room and head up to the top floor and onto the roof of the building. The city is deadly quiet. You don\u2019t hear a sound except the wind gently blowing. In all the revelry you\u2019ve been indulging in, you forgot how much you liked the solitude and silence.\n\nThe loneliness is peaceful.\n\nYou look up in the sky, shielding your eyes from the sun shining down.\n\nYou see a bright light and then nothing at all.\n", "Get another TV and watch the world die": "You grab another TV and sit quietly by yourself in a separate office, watching world events unfold and get worse before your eyes as your co-workers reenact something out of a porno movie. You block out the sounds of ecstasy and turn up the TV. You\u2019re starting to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t have just stayed home, or better yet bought that damn bomb shelter\u2026\n\nJust then someone else comes in to disturb your solitude. It\u2019s Marina.\n\n\n\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t know anyone was in here. I thought everyone was at the orgy.\u201d She says.\n\u201cSo did I\u2026um how come you aren\u2019t?\u201d you ask nervously.\n\u201cEh not really my thing, how come you aren\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cSame here.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026so what are you doing to pass the time?\u201d\n\u201cKeeping up on events to see if things will change for the better.\u201d\n\u201cAh an optimist eh?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, I think I just get a kick out of living in a fantasy world and delusions to make myself feel better\u2026that and I have a morbid fascination of the utter chaos that\u2019s occurring throughout the world right now.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, interesting approach to life\u2026I\u2019ve always noticed you seem to keep to yourself. You like solitude don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier.\u201d\n\u201cYet, you stayed here for the end.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m really wishing I hadn\u2019t now, I can\u2019t mix with anyone here. Never could. Not even on the primal level that everyone seems to be favoring right now. I don\u2019t know why I thought things would change in the end\u2026ah fuck it the world\u2019s gonna end and it\u2019s probably a good thing if our co-workers are an example of humanity. Still\u2026I kind of wish I bought that bomb shelter\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to die?\u201d\n\u201dOf course not! I just don\u2019t really see how to avoid it at this point.\u201d\n\u201cWell, for starters you could come with me; I\u2019m getting ready to leave the city. It seems like things have died down for the most part out there, hopefully nobody\u2019s vandalized or stolen either of our vehicles.\u201d Marina suggests.\n\u201cWhat? Leave? And go where? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s any place really safe to go at this late stage.\u201d\n\u201cSure there is. Look, I\u2019ll level with you, since you seem to be the only one here that\u2019s different. I stayed around here to see if there was anyone who was worthy enough to be saved, and apart from you, it pretty much looks like I wasted my time.\u201d\n\u201cSave? What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell despite the fact that you kept to yourself and never took any interest in any of the private lives of your co-workers doesn\u2019t we don\u2019t have them.\u201d Marina laughs. \u201cBut like you I never really mixed with any of our co-workers either, however unlike you I do have a very active social life filled with people who are close like a family, people who live clean and have a strong sense of freedom\u2026and who have been preparing for this day ever since the Commies started the first Cold War. You don\u2019t have to die and you don\u2019t have to be alone anymore. Come with me, you\u2019ll be accepted as long as you\u2019re willing to work hard and from what I know, you aren\u2019t averse to doing that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not entirely sure of what Marina has in store for you, but it sounds better than staying here waiting to die. You agree to leave with her. You both make your way past the mass of naked bodies and head immediately to the parking structure. Unfortunately Marina\u2019s car is gone, it\u2019s been predictably stolen in the looting frenzy during the city exodus; however your old van is perfectly fine. It hasn\u2019t even been vandalized, of course the thing looks like it\u2019s already been vandalized which is probably why nobody bothered to steal it. You both get in the van and you drive while Marina tells you where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhile you\u2019re driving through the city, you keep expecting to be attacked by lawless hold outs still lingering in the city or open fired on by Nation Guardsman, but you suspect either they were ordered to pull out to reinforce a more important city or most of them abandoned their \u201cjob\u201d long ago when they realized the futility of it. You make your way out of the city with no problems. Of course now you\u2019re just wondering if you\u2019re just going to get nuked at any second. You listen to the radio to keep up on events, which is more of the same that you were watching on TV. Eventually Marina turns it off and tells you not to worry about the old world anymore, a new one is going to be built.\n\nYour drive takes you far from the city, where ever Marina\u2019s leading you it\u2019s even further than where you live and you lived pretty way out. You drive through the night and into next morning; while Marina\u2019s asleep you turn the radio back on and keep it on low\u2026\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n\u201c\u2026BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u2026\u201d\n\nThe radio suddenly stops broadcasting anything except a loud warning sound; it wakes up Marina before you can turn it off. Seeing her current surroundings, Marina hastily tells you to turn at a dirty road that\u2019s coming up, which then leads into a wooden gate. Looks like a compound of some sort, where a man is standing guard with an assault rifle. Marina gets out and talks to him a moment, to which he nods his head and opens the gate.\n\nAs soon as you drive in another woman comes running out of one of the many log cabin like structures in the compound. She immediately starts talking to Marina through the passenger window.\n\n\u201cMarina! Thank God you\u2019re here! We thought you were dead! Come on we gotta get down into the underground, its beginning!\u201d\n\nWasting no time Marina and you follow the woman into the cabin and down into a trap door in the floor. You find yourself in a wide tunnel with dim electrical lighting to what looks like a pretty elaborate underground complex. Marina and the woman are running ahead of you, but you can\u2019t help but stare in wonder of all this.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, they really were working on this since the Cold War\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as you slow down to examine everything.\n\nThen it happens. You hear a loud noise above and you fall to the ground due to the tremors. Then all the lighting goes out. You attempt to get back up and try to feel the walls to get your bearings. You don\u2019t know where the hell you\u2019re going, but you can hear voices and shouting; some of it close and some of it far away. You have no idea where the hell you\u2019re at, let alone the layout of this place. Instead of getting yourself lost, you decide to just stay put until the lighting comes back on; surely they probably have an emergency generator that will kick in soon.\n\nThe lighting suddenly comes on and you\u2019re just in time to see Marina and a man dressed fatigues arrive on your position.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Marina asks you.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nNo sooner do you get out those words when the man in military fatigues begins giving you the hard stare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you before from Marina, but don\u2019t think that hiding behind her skirt is gonna give you a fuckin\u2019 free pass in this place! You better prepared to pull your goddamn weight everyday! I catch you slipping and you\u2019re outta here!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell? I didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you better not say any fuckin\u2019 thing either if you don\u2019t wanna get on my bad side! The Colonel doesn\u2019t like slack offs in his compound and neither do I! So if you intend on staying here, you better get REAL used to the idea of getting your head outta your fuckin\u2019 ass and living like a real fuckin\u2019 person instead of the goddamn disgusting parasitic shit maggot you are!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re about to reply to GI Jerk, but Marina stops you and insists on taking you to your room, leaving Harry to his own devices.\n\n\u201cAlright Marina, what the hell was all that about, and who\u2019s full metal asshole back there?\u201d\n\u201cThat was Harry, and don\u2019t pay any attention to him, he\u2019s just really gung ho and is second in command around here. The Colonel is the one who runs this place. He\u2019s actually a more even tempered man than Harry is.\u201d\n\nMarina and you arrive at a small room by itself at the end of one of the corridors.\n\n\u201cWell here\u2019s the room you\u2019ll be staying for now. Things might change mind you, but rest assured this is the safest place you could be right now. We\u2019ve prepared for this day and will definitely survive the aftermath of what\u2019s to come, and now you will too.\u201d\n\nMarina leaves with a smile, but you don\u2019t really share her optimism, given the fact that Armageddon has just happened. That reality has only just now sunk in that the world is probably one big radioactive desert at this point.\n\nThen again, Marina might be right, this place is probably safer than most and its better than being dead. At least you hope it is. You lie down on the bed provided and fall asleep; surprisingly it\u2019s the best rest you\u2019ve experienced before the bombs dropped.\n\nA few weeks pass and you get acquainted with the compound. You and most of the others are to remain underground while until some scouts in radiation suits determine if the radiation level is low enough. In the mean time you\u2019re forced to do extensive combat training like everyone else. Most of the people are okay with you, even though you\u2019re an outsider. Harry gives you a hard time though. Still, you\u2019re probably in the best shape of your life and you got to brush up on your aim. Sometimes you get to spend time with Marina, funny how you find it easier to talk to her now. One day you finally see the Colonel you\u2019ve been hearing about, he gives a speech to all of you in the cafeteria.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been informed that the surface part of our compound only suffered minor damage and that the radiation level is fairly low all things considering\u2026anyway we all knew this day would come, and we would be prepared for it, but we can\u2019t just sit on our asses hoping things will be alright! NO! We must take a proactive approach if we have to survive! As we speak, there are probably low lives scavenging the shell of the old world, we must secure as many abandoned resources as we can to ensure our future and some of you will be sent out into the world to do just that for the good of the compound. We\u2019re going to tame this new world and rebuild a new society! You have undergone rigorous training before hand, to ensure you will be able to survive the dangers. Now I\u2019ll be accepting volunteers first.\u201d\n", "Volunteer": "Maybe you\u2019re high on your new found physique and adrenaline, but for whatever reason, something comes over you to volunteer. Indeed you\u2019ve made everyone a little surprised by your actions especially since you\u2019re an outsider. The Colonel looks at you with interest.\n\n\n\u201cHmm, you\u2019re the one I\u2019ve heard about from Marina, didn\u2019t expect you to volunteer, she\u2019s always mentioned you\u2019re quiet loner type. Then again, you might be just what I need\u2026alright you\u2019re coming with me. Harry, you start picking some of the others and form recon detachments. Everyone goes on assignment tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel then takes you to his office, where he sits down and gets a bunch of papers from his desk.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sure during your short stay here, you probably think we\u2019re all a bunch of survivalist militia loonies, and to a certain extent, we probably are, however we aren\u2019t without a plan.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel shows you some blueprints to what looks to be a small military base.\n\n\u201cMy friend Alex was stationed at this base. It\u2019s not exactly close by, but its closest military base around here.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize there were any military bases in the area.\u201d\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t, it was a top secret, and kept off the records so it wouldn\u2019t be targeted. There aren\u2019t even any roads leading to the place, you have travel by foot. Though I guess you could say it wasn\u2019t so much of a military base as it was a research facility. Obviously I know about it, because I had a friend stationed there who was feeding me information. He didn\u2019t exactly run the place, but he was attempting to work his way up to get special level clearance. Apparently GZS was working with the government on some high tech weaponry.\u201d\n\u201dGZS?\u201d\n\u201cThe Ground Zero Survival Corporation. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of them, they were the ones hawking their Shelters like snake oil salesmen before doomsday.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, I used to see their commercials on late at night, I thought about buying one of those.\u201d\n\u201cWell good thing you didn\u2019t, only an idiot would\u2019ve bought one of those things. Look at this.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel now shows you a schematic of a GZS Shelter.\n\n\u201cWhy? It certainly looks just as equipped as this compound and has a lot more conveniences.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cIt would appear that way, but the fucking thing is a death trap. They engineered them so once you entered; you most likely couldn\u2019t get out of them. Supposedly the GZS computer is supposed to let you out when it deems that it\u2019s safe to do so. In fact the whole thing is controlled by the computer. A computer that could glitch and break down at anytime. Let a machine be in charge of your survival\u2026yeah great idea. I dunno about you, but I\u2019ll take this compound any day. It might not look pretty, but I don\u2019t have to worry about getting trapped with no access to food or water. Not to mention I heard from Alex that they suffered cutback during the creation of most of those things meaning they cut a lot of damn corners, so they probably aren\u2019t as state of the art as they claimed. I\u2019ll bet those dumb bastards who are living in those things are regretting it as we speak.\u201d\n \nYou\u2019re not sure where he\u2019s going with all this so you interrupt.\n\n\u201cSo, what does all this mean? Are we going to seek out these shelters and rescue the people inside?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! HA HA! That\u2019s a good one!\u201d The Colonel laughs. \u201cHell no son, as far as I\u2019m concerned they\u2019ve made their choice now they can live with it, we\u2019re not here to play white knight. We have to look out for ourselves, and part of that is making sure we\u2019re the best defended and from what I heard, whatever they were working on in that base, sounds like it would make things a lot easier in the defense department.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, hold on, if this is a military base won\u2019t they just shoot me on sight if I go there I mean won\u2019t it be heavily guarded? I mean I know I went through some training, but I doubt to the degree that I can take on an entire military base!\u201d\n\u201cAlex was making friends with most of the lower personnel there, getting them to follow him as it were. Last I heard, he was pretty successful, so chances are, as long as I gave you some identifiers to take with you proving that you were following my orders, you wouldn\u2019t have any problems when you arrived, but obviously there IS a problem or I wouldn\u2019t be sending you at all.\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d you say expecting this assignment to be even more complicated.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from Alex for a month before the bombs dropped. I dunno what\u2019s happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cIs it possible they discovered he was leaking information and killed him?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but chances are that afterwards they would\u2019ve found out about us and also sent the National Guard as well as GZS private security here to lay waste to this compound.\u201d\n\u201cWell the National Guard were busy trying to maintain order to the major cities at the time. I should know I was there when they were stationed in the one I was working at.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I still think they would\u2019ve sent someone here, and GZS still would have. As I said they had enough money to pay for their own security force. Maybe not as well trained as military personnel, but fanatical enough to eliminate anyone that GZS thought was discovering secrets about them. That\u2019s why Alex always focused on solely making friends with the grunts and government officials. The GZS employees always seemed a bit more dedicated to their corporation.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well is it possible that the base wasn\u2019t so secret and it got hit after all?\u201d\n\u201cNope, mainly because I get the impression the background radiation level would be a hell of a lot higher, if that got nuked, so I\u2019m pretty sure the place is intact, in fact I\u2019m guessing its been abandoned. We recently figured out their frequency, we never used it before for obvious reasons, but now, why not? We\u2019re getting a signal, but no verbal answers from anyone. To sum up, I want you to go there to scout and explore as much as you can. Find out what the hell happened to Alex if possible, and let me know if that high tech weaponry is worth anything or just more bad engineering by GZS. Here. You\u2019ll probably need this security pass to enter, got it from Alex, last time he was here; I hope it\u2019s still valid. And here\u2019s my ring and a letter, if Alex IS still alive then those will prove that you\u2019re working for me. That\u2019s all I can do to help other than to give you a map to the place and what equipment you think you\u2019ll need.\u201d\n\nBefore you leave you have to ask.\n\n\u201cOkay why me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy you? You volunteered son!\u201d\n\u201cI know, but for this particular job, surely you have others more qualified to tackle it.\u201d\n\u201cEh\u2026you MIGHT think that, but to be quite honest, no. I mean don\u2019t get me wrong I see all of these people here as family, but a lot of them are a bunch of weekend warriors who were playing survival. I\u2019m sure in the years to come we\u2019re going to see who\u2019s a REAL soldier and who isn\u2019t. Not that it matters, I mean I\u2019ll find something for them to do, but you\u2019re different. You certainly aren\u2019t some commando, but there\u2019s definitely something about you that makes you seem a bit more\u2026detached from everything else. Like you\u2019ll be willing to do what\u2019s necessary to survive without hesitation. While you may never have been in a situation like this one, I got a feeling you\u2019ll do just fine. Besides Marina\u2019s previous beaming remarks about you are good enough for me. Now go get some rest, you\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou head back to your room and think about what the Colonel said. He might be right in a lot of ways, but you still wonder if he\u2019s sending you because as he said, \u201cAll these people here are like family, but you\u2019re different.\u201d Maybe if you get killed it won\u2019t feel like such a loss. You don\u2019t think anymore about it, mainly because Marina enters your room to interrupt your thoughts.\n\n\u201cI hear you\u2019re leaving tomorrow, I just want to tell you how brave I think you are for doing this for all of us. I know we didn\u2019t get a lot of quality time with each other, but I wanted us to spend at least what could be the last time I see you together.\u201d\n\nMarina\u2019s ominous words that imply how much danger you\u2019re possibly getting yourself into might worry you more if she wasn\u2019t on top of you right now\u2026\n\nThe next day you load up with what you think you might need, water, food, rifle, pistol, knife, Geiger counter, all the basic essentials. You get a bunch of goodbyes and good lucks. Harry merely sneers and mentions he expects you to get yourself killed twenty feet after you leave. The Colonel is a little more supportive and gives you a silent salute, but you like Marina\u2019s goodbye kiss best of all.\n\nAnd with that, you\u2019re on your way. It\u2019s actually amazing to see that the outside world doesn\u2019t look drastically different, you can only assume the bombs didn\u2019t hit near your area. When you\u2019re out of sight of the compound, you go back to thinking about this mission you volunteered for and wondering if you should go through with it. You do have the suitable equipment and skills to survive off the land after all.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to just go AWOL as it were\u2026\n", "Continue with your mission": "You volunteered and you\u2019re going to see it through, might not be that dangerous as you think especially if the place is indeed abandoned.\n\nYou spend a few days crossing over hills and some plains. For awhile you think someone\u2019s following you, but never see a soul, actually you\u2019re wondering about the Geiger counter readings more than anything, but you\u2019re guessing there wasn\u2019t any nuclear blast the direction you\u2019re going. You also guess that seeing trees up ahead is also a good sign. You would\u2019ve dressed yourself in a radiation suit, but the Colonel kept insisting it wouldn\u2019t be necessary and for the mission that Harry was sending some of the others on would need them more.\n\n\u201cShit! I forgot to take a radio!\u201d you say to yourself finally realizing that it would\u2019ve been nice to radio in to the Compound if you had something important to report, like being unable to enter the base because snipers were shooting at you.\n\nHappily that doesn\u2019t seem to occur when you finally arrive. You almost aren\u2019t even sure if you\u2019re at the right place at first. The Compound is bigger, then again this place probably has an extensive underground, and as the Colonel said, it was more like a research facility than a proper military base.\n\nStill there\u2019s something a little weird about all this, it seems like security would be of major importance for a place like this, yet there\u2019s nobody here guarding the outside and you just walked through open gates. Maybe the place is abandoned, but they could all be underground though, (That would certainly be more sensible than wandering around exposing themselves to radioactive wind\u2026)\n\nThe surface offices and barracks don\u2019t look like anyone left in a hurry; in fact a lot of the barracks still have their equipment. (You take some extra ammo for your assault rifle) You search through some of papers you find in the offices, but there\u2019s nothing of any importance. Just mundane status reports of personnel guard duties. You find a few letters with GZS logos on them, but again nothing telling you much.\n\nNothing else for it, but to go underground. You approach the solid metal structure at the far end of the base. Looks like an elevator door with an ATM machine near it. There\u2019s a slot and some button, so you\u2019re guessing this is where you shove your security pass that the Colonel gave you. Hope it works or you came all this way for nothing. You slide the pass in the slot.\n\n\u201cIdentification recognized. GZS wishes you a pleasant day in all your endeavors sir!\u201d a chipper female voice sounds as the elevator door opens.\n\nNot exactly what you were expecting, GZS must\u2019ve had more input here than the Colonel thought. You\u2019re a little nervous as you press the elevator button down, you expect the worst. The elevator eventually reaches its destination and opens up to a corridor. You cautiously exit. You don\u2019t get far when a cybernetic being comes from around a corner and points its arm at you, which is doubling as a weapon of some sort, one that would blow a big hole in you.\n\n\u201cLower your weapon and please come with me sir. Alex will want to see you. Any attempt to attack or escape will be met with extreme use of force.\u201d\n", "Go with the cyborg": "You lower your rifle (But still hold on to it) and walk side by side with the cyborg who is surprisingly chatty, you also see it walks a bit irregularly, like it hasn\u2019t been spliced together correctly.\n\n\u201cAlex will be most pleased to see you; you\u2019ll be the first human here in months!\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to all the others?\u201d\n\u201cOh well most of them have been improved like m-m-m-m.\u201d the cyborg hits itself in the head before he stops stuttering \u201cLike me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, some improvement.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, its not so bad. Alex promises to give us a tune up when he gets the necessary time, he is only one man after all. Some assistants would certainly help.\u201d\n\u201cSo Alex is a surgeon?\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s not really. I mean he didn\u2019t start out that way at least, but he\u2019s completely self taught and trying to learn more each day! Sure there have been some failures, but there\u2019s also been success! Why look at m-m-m-m.\u201d the cyborg hits itself in the head again while you just shake yours. You can see this is going to be an interesting meeting.\n\n\u201cSo who were you before Alex\u2026uh improved you.\u201d\n\u201cOh I was a regular military man who guarded this base with no real identity. Just a name and a number really.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cNow I\u2019m known as J-34 and I protect Alex!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 so everyone here is a cyborg like you?\u201d\n\u201cJust about. Most military personnel were friends with Alex before being renewed, so they were happy to be improved. The GZS personnel weren\u2019t so enthusiastic about the idea, in fact they were mad that Alex discovered their top secret project. They tried to stop him, but they were stopped instead. Alex saw that the project would be pointless in trying to perfect it to use in a war that was going to be over in six minutes. Better that it should be applied to those that would surely survive the aftermath of that same war. Here we are, I\u2019m sure Alex will want to hear all about the outside world, hey maybe he\u2019ll improve you too!\u201d\n\nYou enter an office where a man sits at a desk pouring over technical manuals and medical books. Two more cyborgs armed with some sort science fictionish weapons stand by him. There\u2019s no way you could hope to kill him without them killing you as well. He looks up.\n\n\n\u201cAh a guest! Been a long time since we\u2019ve seen anyone new\u2026in fact I\u2019m a little puzzled on how you even found this place, let alone entered it\u2026you\u2019re not GZS are you?\u201d Alex says changing his pleasant demeanor in mid sentence.\n\u201cNo! Not at all! I\u2019m here because the Colonel sent me. He says you and he are friends. Here. Here\u2019s his ring and a letter he wrote to prove it. He\u2019d also given me a security pass so I could enter this place.\u201d\n\nAlex takes the ring and letter and inspects them both, before addressing you again.\n\n\u201cWell it looks like everything\u2019s legitimate. I shall trust you. Though I\u2019m not sure I trust the Colonel. I never did trust him. He only wanted to use me so I could get access to high tech weaponry, but instead I found much more here! Much more than I ever told him! Ha ha! I hear him trying to radio in, wondering if there\u2019s anyone here, I\u2019ve been ignoring him. He and his group of right wing loonies are unworthy of being re-made. If they think they\u2019re true survivialists then they don\u2019t need the gifts that this base provides. All of it is mine, I EARNED this place and it shall be I who ushers in a new era. Not GZS, not the government and not the fucking goddamn Colonel!\u201d\n\nAlex is obviously unhinged, you don\u2019t know if he was always this way or got that way later, but it hardly matters, what\u2019s of major importance is that you walk away from this meeting unscathed. You try to calm him down.\n\n\u201cWhoa hold on, I don\u2019t think the Colonel or any of his right wing loonies would want to be re-made.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, anyone with any sense of survival would want to be re-made if they new about what was being worked on here.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t help, but notice that Alex hasn\u2019t done any improvements on himself\u2026\n\n\u201cHowever, I can see you don\u2019t share that same short sighted thinking that the rest of those Compound cronies do. You are worthy of being re-made! In fact I would like to start now, I\u2019ve been studying up on some new techniques and I would love to test them out. I think I could do a really good job this time, there will definitely be less acc\u2026er complications than in the past.\u201d\n\nThis is just getting worse. Now this nutjob wants to work on you.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to be re-made! I was just here to see if you were alive and scout this place out! Now that I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019m to return to the Compound!\u201d\n\u201cOh well now that\u2019s going to be a problem\u2026I can\u2019t risk you telling him what\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nYou really didn\u2019t want to hear that.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll tell the Colonel that there wasn\u2019t anything here, I can reason with him. You can even take my security pass to make sure I can\u2019t get back in if you\u2019re really worried. However, if he doesn\u2019t hear from me, he\u2019s only going to send more folks to this place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of it? They wouldn\u2019t be able to get in and even if they could, his weekend warriors would be no match for Cybernetic Evolution!\u201d\n\u201cNo, but they could just blow up the elevator trapping you down here forever, and you\u2019ll never be able to leave to allow your genius to usher in the new era that you were talking about.\u201d\n\nThat seems to relax Alex a bit, as always a little flattery goes a long way to ease an unbalanced mind.\n\n\u201cHmm, perhaps you make some sense, and you seem like a trustworthy sort\u2026very well. I shall arrange for you to leave. Give me your security pass.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, and I\u2019ll be needing the Colonel\u2019s ring and letter back, so I can say I didn\u2019t find anything here.\u201d\n\nYou and Alex exchange items and he and his two cyborg guards escort you back to the elevator.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, perhaps if we meet again you will be more receptive to being re-made. It\u2019s a harsh new world, and you\u2019ll soon wish you had an edge to survive it.\u201d Alex tells you before you leave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do alright.\u201d\n \nThe elevator goes up and you\u2019re back on the surface again where you make your trek back to the compound in just a few days. You notice there have been a few changes in the few days you\u2019ve left. Namely there\u2019s a still to make hooch. And you now have some working vehicles that been modified to run on hooch. The same still that people are making cheap booze from they\u2019re also using it as fuel, which basically translates into the vehicles running on \u201cgarbage\u201d given that\u2019s what the booze is being made out of. Smells pretty bad, but whatever works. Though from what you heard some towns have been found to be running their vehicles on shit (animal AND human) so the smell could be worse. There\u2019s been a couple deaths from some of the other recon missions, but for the most part everything else is normal.\n\nEveryone\u2019s almost surprised to see you come back, Marina\u2019s happy, Harry obviously isn\u2019t. The Colonel though wants to see you immediately.\n\nSince you don\u2019t owe any allegiance to some nutcase playing Frankenstein in an underground base, you tell the Colonel everything. You expect him to get mad at you, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Alex always was a bit unstable; I always wondered why the army never gave him a section 8. Anyway, what you\u2019re telling me doesn\u2019t surprise me, though I wish you could\u2019ve gotten away without giving up that security pass. It\u2019s going to be harder to get down there now.\u201d\n\u201cYou still want to go down there?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! What you think I\u2019m going to let Alex slowly refine and build up his cyborg army? Who do you think he\u2019s going to attack first? No, we need to get rid of him NOW. I suppose we could blow up the elevator doors to gain access. Not like we don\u2019t have the means to do that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t you run the risk of blowing up the entire elevator, and causing it fall and crash down the shaft? We wouldn\u2019t be able to send anyone down there in an efficient manner. Let alone fighting off cyborgs who would cut us down with ease if we were trying to repel down the shaft or huddled together coming off the elevator, besides Alex might have left the elevator on his level given the recent visit of mine.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel lets forth another sigh knowing that you make a good point, but frustrated as well.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, so what do you suggest we do then? Sit and do nothing with our thumbs up our asses?\u201d\n", "Suggest in hacking the security system, then invading the base.": "\u201cWell I suppose you\u2019re right in that we need to stop Alex, but blowing up the elevator still isn\u2019t going to help, I suggest we hack the security system to gain control of it properly and then send down the invasion force and hope we can deal with the robots and cyborgs down there.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSounds like a better plan, I didn\u2019t know you had so much computer experience though, let alone able to hack into a secret army base.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t. I mean, don\u2019t you have people like that here?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, but you seem to be new here, hello welcome to the Compound\u2026NO OF COURSE I DON\u2019T I HAVE ANYONE LIKE THAT HERE! Sheesh! It\u2019s not like we figured advanced computer hacking skills are going to be that useful when the world is blown back to the stone age! So you mean you don\u2019t have the ability to pull off this amazing plan of yours?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not really, not to that degree at least\u2026I suppose there\u2019s just taking the panel apart and re-wiring it so it opens up for us though, you got any electricians or someone of that nature?\u201d\n\u201cYeah a few, but I hope you do too, because you\u2019re going to assist the team since you\u2019re the idea man for all of this. After you clean out all the cyborgs and whatever the hell else Alex has built down there, remember to grab those weapons and come back. We\u2019ll go back to occupy the base later. Now go select your team and whatever else you think you might need.\u201d\n\nAfter asking for the names of the electronically \u201cgifted\u201d around the place, you go about following the Colonel\u2019s orders and saying goodbye to Marina again, she looks more confident that you\u2019ll return this time, you wish you could feel the same.\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you\u2019re in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard. Looks like your friend Alex also dabbles in robotics as well as cybernetics. You and your team hide behind the outer wall when you all catch sight of it. Apparently Alex didn\u2019t trust you any more than you trusted him, and looks like both of you were right.\n\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s that?\u201d one of your team members asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a robot, what\u2019s it look like?\u201d\n\u201cWell what\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d\n\u201cKill it! Everyone open fire!\u201d\n\nYou have no idea if your bullets are going to penetrate its armor, but you you\u2019re going to try anyway. Everyone fires upon the robotic being, which begins to shutter and spark, but returns fire and a bright burst of light strikes one of your team members and completely incinerates him.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, get cover and keep firing!\u201d you shout.\n\nThe rest of the battle doesn\u2019t last too much longer, while your team continue to fire bursts at the machine while they dodge plasma blasts, you get enough time to toss a grenade at it and blow it to smithereens. Shards of burnt twisted metal lie all over the place.\n\n\u201cCome on we need to open up that door, before something else comes out of the damn thing!\u201d\n\nYou and a few others start working on the card reader, trying to get it open as fast as possible. You don\u2019t even know how you\u2019re going to rewire the damn thing; you\u2019ll just keep doing something until something else happens! As it turns out you didn\u2019t need to do anything, while you and few others are fumbling around, the elevator doors open. At first you think you it was you who opened them, but in fact it was Alex who was controlling the elevator from the bottom. Two heavily armed cyborgs exit and begin firing immediately turning most of your team into charred skeletons. You manage to just barely get away and duck behind one of the buildings. Fortunately they don\u2019t seem to be very fast, so when they try to chase you, you toss a few grenades in their direction, blowing them up in the same manner you destroyed the robot, except a bit bloodier, given their human bits.\n\nYou come out of your hiding place and see nothing left of your team, they\u2019ve all been killed. The elevator door is still open; you could enter and finish the job, or return to the Compound in failure.\n", "Enter": "You take a deep breath and enter the elevator taking it down. As soon as it opens you step out and blaze away at the first metallic monster that pops from around the corner, hitting it critically in some vital component. In fact you\u2019re doing okay all things considering, but as they say, it usually isn\u2019t thing that you\u2019re expecting that gets you.\n\nThinking you have a breather, you duck into one of the rooms to reload; unfortunately you feel a dart go into your back, before you enter it. You pull it out and see it\u2019s a tranquilizer dart. Already you feel drowsy, and begin to collapse. You ban barely make him out in your current state, but Alex soon enters with a victorious look on his face, holding his tranquilizer gun.\n\n\u201cWell, it looks like I was right to not trust you, but you\u2019ll be able to repay me back soon enough. Trust me, you\u2019ll thank me for this remaking.\u201d\n\nDespite Alex\u2019s claims you\u2019re unable to do much talking at all after Alex remakes you, let alone thanking him. He basically designs you in such a way that only your basic brain functions remain. Just enough for you to obey simple commands such as \u201cAttack the Compound\u201d.\n\nObeying that command is the last thing you do, before you\u2019re eventually blown to bits during Alex\u2019s attack on the Compound.\n", "Leave": "There\u2019s no way you can take on the rest by yourself, at the very least you need to get reinforcements! You\u2019d radio in, but one of the other team members was carrying it, and he was fricasseed. Plus you don\u2019t want to be around if anymore of Alex\u2019s creations come up. Time for a full scale invasion, looks like the Colonel was right.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just what the Colonel tells you, when he\u2019s chewing your ass out for losing valuable people and equipment in an attempt to go through with your plan. His respect for you is severely lowered, in fact the entire Compound\u2019s respect for you is lowered. Harry makes every effort to taunt you, and even Marina becomes distant. (Obviously you weren\u2019t the \u201cman\u201d she thought you were.) Your status in the Compound is pretty much nil, when the Colonel finally organizes an invasion party; you of course aren\u2019t included.\n\nNow knowing another invasion attempt is probably coming, Alex really beefed up his defenses; the invasion force doesn\u2019t even set foot into the base before getting blasted by superior cyborg weaponry. Reinforcements are called in, but they don\u2019t help. The base is too well defended now. A retreat is called, and the Compound has to abandon its invasion indefinitely. In fact all exploration is called off; since the Colonel decides he can\u2019t afford to lose anyone else. (One of the only reasons why you\u2019re kept around) The Compound just becomes a \u201cplace\u201d where everyone lives because it\u2019s safer than living outside it. The ideas of \u201crebuilding\u201d civilization are abandoned. Morale certainly isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nOf course none of that means shit to Alex, who only steps up his plans for conquest.\n\nA year passes without another incident and then the day happens which you all hoped would never happen, but somehow expected it would. Alex\u2019s army arrives, and what\u2019s worse is they now outnumber you. Alex must\u2019ve been capturing people in the wastelands or something. He\u2019s also improved his abilities, they\u2019re even tougher, and worse they\u2019re faster.\n\nYou don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, and this place is your home such as it is. You figure maybe you can regain some respect by defending the place.\n\nYou and the rest prepare to defend the Compound. Harry is predictably yelling orders at everyone, while the Colonel is attempting to boost morale with inspirational speeches. None of it really helps though when the first wave of cyborgs easily melt the gate into liquid metal and blast holes in the walls.\n\nThen they proceed to melt the people into liquid pulp, and blast holes in their bodies, you are no exception.\n", "Suggest in containing Alex instead": "Funny that you are about to suggest an idea to the Colonel that got you out of trouble with Alex in the first place.\n\n\u201cNo, I think you do have a good idea about stopping Alex, I saw first hand how crazy he was. Maybe we can\u2019t actually get to him, but we could contain him.  We blow up the elevator like you wanted to do and then dump explosives down the shaft, it should collapse things enough that they won\u2019t be able to leave, and we won\u2019t lose any people.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I like the way you think, but suppose they attempt get out, or rebuild the elevator or something?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we could leave a permanent detachment there to keep a constant vigil. I mean the surface part of the base is completely usable. That way we get an early warning just in case anything does try to come out.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting idea. Having two command centers would be a good idea, I was planning on expansion in the future, might as well start now. Should keep us alert as well. Can\u2019t afford to get sloppy out here. Okay. We\u2019ll go with that idea, and since you came up with it, you can oversee the operation. In fact consider yourself stationed there until further notice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cHey I have to put someone there, you\u2019ve done a good job so far and you have the best experience with the place so you can be in charge. Think of it as an honor son! I have a lot faith in you and I don\u2019t have much in anyone.\u201d\n\u201cWell thanks, but wouldn\u2019t someone like Harry be a better choice?\u201d\n\u201dHarry? Yeah, he\u2019s got his uses, but I\u2019d rather not have him in charge of anything important like this, no I want you and few others to go, in fact you pick them. I\u2019ll let you know if I can afford to spare them.\u201d\n\u201cWell then I pick Marina right now.\u201d\n\u201cI expected that. Sure, if you can convince her to go. Just remember what you\u2019re there for! Okay go pick out your team and gather what equipment you might need.\u201d\n\nYou leave and tell Marina the situation immediately, she of course agrees to go with you, though she\u2019s a little worried about being someplace with a bunch of cyborgs several feet underneath her, of course you\u2019re worried about the same thing.\n\nYou pick out six more people of varying skills, but mostly people you were getting along with during your stay at the Compound. You don\u2019t want to take anyone who you\u2019re not going to get along with. The Colonel approves of your choice and gives you the okay, Harry looks positively jealous that he was passed over for you who just got here. In fact before you leave he tells you as much.\n\n\u201cYou fucking little pissant. You think because you\u2019re all chummy with the Colonel that you\u2019re his fucking second in command now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right no! If anything happens to the Colonel I\u2019M in charge of this shit! You better remember that fuckhead! Because if you\u2019re still on my list when that occurs, you best pray to God that I at least lube your asshole after I rip off your pink panties and before I shove my foot up it and make your colon my permanent fuckin\u2019 sock!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little bewildered by the logic of this comment, you almost can\u2019t be sure if he\u2019s threatening you, or flirting with you. You don\u2019t feel like arguing with him though since it won\u2019t accomplish anything, besides if any good is coming from this, it\u2019s getting away from him. You and your team leave.\n\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you\u2019re in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard. Looks like your friend Alex also dabbles in robotics as well as cybernetics. You and your team hide behind the outer wall when you all catch sight of it. Apparently Alex didn\u2019t trust you any more than you trusted him, and looks like both of you were right.\n\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s that?\u201d one of your team members asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a robot, what\u2019s it look like?\u201d\n\u201cWell what\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d\n\u201cKill it! Everyone open fire!\u201d\n\nYou have no idea if your bullets are going to penetrate its armor, but you you\u2019re going to try anyway. Everyone fires upon the robotic being, which begins to shutter and spark, but returns fire and a bright burst of light strikes one of your team members and completely incinerates him.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, get cover and keep firing!\u201d you shout.\n\nThe rest of the battle doesn\u2019t last too much longer, while your team continue to fire bursts at the machine while they dodge plasma blasts, you get enough time to toss a grenade at it and blow it to smithereens. Shards of burnt twisted metal lie all over the place.\n\n\u201cCome on we need to blow up that door, before something else comes out of the damn thing!\u201d\n\nYou and the rest apply charges to the elevator door and run before it explodes. Just like you though, Alex doesn\u2019t have the elevator on the surface anymore, it\u2019s at the bottom, in fact its ascending right now!\n\n\u201cDump grenades down the fuckin\u2019 shaft!\u201d\n\nThis action is followed by running far away from the elevator, a large explosion, and then a large crash and another smaller explosion. You ask for a flashlight and peer down the shaft. Its smoking mess and from what you can tell, part of the structure collapsed in on itself. Nothing is going to be coming out of there for a long time. You\u2019re about to radio in and tell the Colonel the news when another signal breaks in, its Alex\u2026\n\n\u201cSo, that snitch told after all! I knew he wasn\u2019t to be trusted! You can\u2019t stop me! I\u2019ll get out of here eventually! And I shall\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGot news for you Alex, you\u2019re talking to the snitch right now, and you won\u2019t be going anywhere as long as I\u2019m here. Enjoy your underground prison.\u201d\n\nYou switch to another frequency and tell the Colonel who seems pleased, he tells you he\u2019ll keep in contact with you on a regular basis and send more people when possible, in the mean time secure the place and get settled in.\n\nA few more weeks pass and eventually the initial nervousness disappears from everyone, Alex still breaks in ranting on your radio frequency every now and then, but you ignore him. In fact being at the base turns out to be more to your liking, there\u2019s less people around, you\u2019re in charge and you get to spend more time with Marina.\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nNot too much changes around the base (Which you now call Pandora which seems appropriate since you\u2019re keeping in something that shouldn\u2019t be let out!) a few more people are transferred here, supplies are delivered back and forth, but not much else happens. You get reports from the Compound every now and then, seems they\u2019ve made progress with a few small towns that survived, but there are a lot of problems with lawless bandits running around. Reports have also mentioned strange mutated animals lurking about too. Sounds like they have everything under control so far though. The Colonel has the idea to trade with the towns and offer protection when possible. He hopes to get more people to join the Compound you imagine.\n\nYour orders are still the same, just guard Pandora, and make sure no cybernetic horrors are coming out. Sometimes you wonder if you shouldn\u2019t be doing something else, indeed Marina seems to think so. Sometimes you forget she\u2019s been training in all this survivalist shit longer than you have and has that \u201ctame the wasteland\u201d spirit more than you do.\n", "Stay put": "You decide that you got it made, why fuck with it? The rest of those at the Compound have to go on missions to fight bandits and go exploring possible hostile locations. You don\u2019t need to do any of that. You\u2019re in a nice safe isolated location where nobody ever comes except to drop off supplies every now and then. Even the fact cyborgs are trapped underneath you doesn\u2019t bother you anymore. You continue your routine.\n\nFour more years pass...\n\nYou and Marina are still together, but for some reason, you don\u2019t seem as close anymore. It seems like she\u2019s been getting distant in the past few years.\n\nYou still get the harassing radio rant from Alex every now and then just to let you know he\u2019s still alive along with his robots and cyborgs. You\u2019re guessing he\u2019s been surviving on rats and roaches down there.\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you first joined the Compound and there\u2019s been a lot more changes there at least that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been hearing from the people transferred to Pandora.\n\nYou get less and less reports from the Compound itself other than its undergone a name change and due to its inclusion of a few towns now, its called the Combine and the Compound itself is called Fort Justice. You know about how the Colonel has gotten sick and seems to be getting worse as more time passes and how the population rate is growing, but it\u2019s slow. The major theory is the elevated levels of background radiation are probably affecting fertility. (You wonder about yourself and Marina since she hasn\u2019t once gotten pregnant in the five years you\u2019ve been together) There have been more people sent here, mainly people that aren\u2019t \u201ccutting it\u201d anymore at the Compound. In fact you\u2019ve been hearing some interesting stories. One man in particular called Roger has spoken to you quite frankly about what\u2019s been going on at the Compound some of it a bit alarming.\n\n\n\u201cThe fuckin\u2019 Colonel? When he started getting sick that sonofabitch Harry started taking over more responsibility. Started doing shit HIS way, which was a lot more reactionary. I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not some faggot peacenik, I\u2019m all about creating a new strong society, like how America SHOULD\u2019VE been, but fuck man. I\u2019m not gonna kill children for no goddamn reason!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! When did this happen?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a year ago! I was on a mission to this small town called Lost Springs and Harry was with us personally. They had a fresh underground supply of water, so we really wanted to gather them into the fold. Talks didn\u2019t go so well though, so Harry went nuts and shot the fucking mayor of the town! Then he proceeded to tell us to start killing all the kids if they didn\u2019t submit to us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cWell I refused to do it, and some of the others didn\u2019t either. A few did though, and after a couple of kids were killed. The rest of the townsfolk pretty much fell in line. Harry left the ones who were willing to kill at his command to occupy the place. He made up a damn story to the Colonel about how he HAD to do it and left out the shooting kids though. And the Colonel gets sicker and sicker, and Harry gets freer reign. Shit, if the Colonel wasn\u2019t still alive I think Harry wouldn\u2019t even be sending some people here, he\u2019d probably be sending them all to the city.\u201d\n\u201cWait, the city? There\u2019s missions to the city? I thought those were stopped after the first few times that was attempted.\u201d\n\u201cNot anymore! Harry\u2019s been sending a few people on his shit list to missions on the city. Harry says that there are still important resources to be gathered from there. Its bullshit, ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 there except fuckin\u2019 mutants and radioactivity! I probably would\u2019ve got sent there, but I lost my arm in an ambush, and the Colonel said I needed to be taken off of active duty and sent here. There\u2019s a real mean motherfucker loyal to Harry called Damon, who goes on the city missions to ensure nobody tries to go AWOL. He\u2019s fucking nuts, he loves going into the city; I think he actually gets a fucking orgasm.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell is Harry getting all these new people, if he\u2019s treating the towns so badly?\u201d\n\u201cI told you he\u2019s been press ganging some of them and most are so beaten by that point that they just go along with it, but he\u2019s also been subduing some of the raider scum! That\nDamon is one of those fuckers. Instead of killing them all like we should be doing, he\u2019s been recruiting them into the Combine! These degenerates are usually the ones he uses for occupation since most of them don\u2019t have any qualms about killing anything that moves and they\u2019re used to terrorizing towns.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, I\u2019ve never heard about all this before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re lucky you got assigned here when you did, because you\nwould\u2019ve been going to the city. The only thing keeping you safe is the Colonel who insists you stay in charge of this place; I don\u2019t want to think about the day when the Colonel finally croaks. Shit, I might just leave and take my chances, one arm be damned. YOU might want to think about leaving as well, because chances are Harry\u2019s going to be turning his attention towards you when that day comes.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see what the hell I did to him, he\u2019s hated me since day one.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you got the Colonel\u2019s attention and his respect. You got a command position of your very own base, and most importantly you got Marina. He\u2019s always liked her. You didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cWell she did mention one time that he came on to her in the past, well anyway, it hardly matters why he hates me I guess. What matters is I gotta think about how I\u2019m gonna deal with this problem in the future.\u201d\n\nSuddenly one of your assistants comes in and has something to report. Something you really don\u2019t want to know after having been given the recent information by Roger.\n\nThe Colonel has died, Harry has taken complete control of the Combine and his first order is for YOU to return to Fort Justice for reassignment.\n\nLooks like you\u2019ll have to be thinking fast.\n", "Leave the Combine": "Secession isn\u2019t really a viable option. You simply can\u2019t stand up to the resources Harry has, the only option is to distance yourself as far away as possible. Harry\u2019s escorts will be here in a few days so you start packing immediately. Marina wonders what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the hell outta here! You think Harry\u2019s gonna let me live? At best he might be sending me into missions into the city! Fuck that!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean we\u2019re just leaving? We\u2019re not fighting back?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you think I like this? I mean I don\u2019t want to leave, but if we stay, we\u2019re gonna end up dead! Come on pack your shit.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I can\u2019t just leave everything. I mean I\u2019m still friends and close to all these people, I can\u2019t just leave them.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve actually gotten along with most of the folks here too, but I\u2019m not sticking my neck out for any of them. Besides, if they\u2019re smart they\u2019ll leave too.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nYou stop packing.\n\n\u201cWhat, are you fucking kidding me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean I can\u2019t do it. This is my life, this was my life before the bombs and it\u2019ll continue to be my life afterwards. I can\u2019t just leave, I mean we\u2019re trying to re-build society\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck society! Why can\u2019t it just be me and you?\u201d\n\nMarina suddenly tells you a revelation you always had an inkling of, but never quite sure until today\u2026\n\n\u201cYou know why I liked you in the beginning? Because all those years we worked in that office I saw a man who worked hard in a mundane job yet had the potential to be something more under the right circumstances. I\u2019m sure you remember I said something similar five years ago when I convinced you to come with me. Then you proved me right somewhat by volunteering and taking charge of this place. I knew I\u2019d chosen right. I was in love with you.\u201d\n\u201cWas eh?\u201d\n\u201cYes, was. In the following years of you taking command of this place you\u2019ve shown no more initiative. You\u2019ve been content to just do the mundane routine of running this place. You were doing exactly the opposite of what I first saw. You were squandering your potential.\u201d\n\u201cSo what was I supposed to be doing then Marina? Driving across the fuckin\u2019 wasteland shooting up people, taking their shit, and declaring their town part of the Combine like Harry?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not. But you could\u2019ve done something more. Like sending out your own exploration teams, or even going on them yourself. Maybe if you had, you wouldn\u2019t be in this position now. You\u2019d have better leverage to face Harry. Maybe he is a fucking dictator, but he\u2019s accomplishing a goal.\u201d\n\nYou pack the last of your things and start walking while Marina follows you.\n\n\u201cYeah, some goal\u2026Okay you know what Marina, fuck it. I gotta get outta here, and its apparent you\u2019ve made your decision and I\u2019m not gonna try to talk you out of it, because if you\u2019re that willing to throw fuckin\u2019 five years away just because I\u2019m not the wasteland warrior that you dreamed up in your mind, then like I said fuck it. You\u2019re not worth my time either anymore. I hope you and Harry have a nice life, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Hope for your sake though his obsession for you is a lot stronger than his vindictiveness.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you! It\u2019s not that goddamn black and white! I don\u2019t like fuckin Harry, and I never will, but\u2026HEY! Don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 walk out on me!\u201d\n\nYou storm out of the base, and Marina attempts to reason and explain, but it\u2019s all bullshit to you. This whole thing was. Trying to \u201crebuild\u201d society, yeah right. As if there was anything worth rebuilding in the first place. You\u2019re done with this shit. You tried it and it was okay for awhile, but now its time to move on. Away from this and away from people.\n\nYou travel for a few days, and you expect Harry\u2019s men to come tracking you, but nobody ever follows you. You get attacked by a few mutated wolves, and a few mad men here and there, but nobody from the Combine. It\u2019s possible that you\u2019ve done a good job of throwing them off, and Harry\u2019s people aren\u2019t skilled trackers, of course maybe Harry\u2019s just glad you\u2019re out of the way period. You briefly have an amusing thought, that Marina still had some sort of feelings for you and offered to be Harry\u2019s girl in exchange of letting you live.\n\nYou decide to think that\u2019s what happened, since you\u2019ll never know for certain and you\u2019ve always been prone to imagine dramatic movie like endings.\n\n\u201cHeh. We\u2019ll always have Pandora.\u201d You laugh to yourself as you distance yourself further away from Combine territory.\n", "Secede from the Combine": "\"Fuck off Harry, and take your Combine and shove it up your ass. We\u2019re seceding.\u201d You abruptly tell him over the radio, before announcing your intensions to everyone else in the base.\n\nYou get a mixed reaction of apprehension, while a lot of them aren\u2019t too fond of Harry, they still like living with basic necessities, something that becomes apparent in the weeks to come. There are a number of problems from the beginning.\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re an isolated community and while that has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks, meaning the instant you tell Harry to fuck off and die over the radio, you\u2019re no longer getting any supplies of any kind, you\u2019re stuck with what you have. Medical supplies are scarce as it is; now they\u2019re non-existent. Forget about getting new ammo too.\n\nFood is a bit of a problem, (Water isn\u2019t, the base has its own water recycling and filtering system, fortunately it\u2019s on the surface rather than underground) since you were getting a majority of that from Fort Justice. Some hunting is done in the surrounding wilderness. It becomes a major problem though when Harry sends an invasion detachment and cuts you off from even doing that. It\u2019s not even like you can start farming even if you had the means since the inside of the base is completely paved (as well as harboring a deranged doctor and his cyborgs)\n\nThe only thing that prevents him from completely taking the place is the fact he\u2019s spread a bit thin in other areas of the Combine with keeping control of other towns and you\u2019re pretty well fortified. Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t continue to harass you, and he can keep supplying his people. You can\u2019t. His people are somewhat more battle hardened as well. Not that you\u2019re saddled with a bunch of non-combatants, but anyone that\u2019s still following Harry willingly has been indoctrinated with a little more fanatic conformity, which is a great thing to have in a soldier. So great, you wish you had more people like that.\n\nA couple months after the initial siege; most people are ready to throw you to Harry\u2019s men in exchange for mercy. Marina and few others stand by you, but its mob rule. You\u2019re overwhelmed, disarmed and thrown to the invasion force outside.\n\nAll that still stayed loyal to you are immediately shot as traitors. The ones that turned on you are merely beaten (and a few of them shot to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again)\n\nYou and Marina are taken back to Harry. He gets a sadistic pleasure out of having you beaten in front of Marina. He attempts to give Marina one last chance to submit, but she refuses causing him to slap her upside the face and then start to rip off her clothes. You yell out, but are promptly beaten by Harry\u2019s guards again. Unfortunately for all his bravado Harry\u2019s unable to get it up. He tries like hell since he wants you to watch, but for whatever reason, his attempt at rape is a complete failure. Knowing the end is near anyway, Marina laughs at him before he smashes her skull against the ground yelling and screaming at her whole time.\n\nHe then kicks your bloody body and blames you for having to do that, you spit out a gob of blood and some teeth.\n\n\n\u201cEnjoy your fuckin\u2019 empire, you limp dick bitch.\u201d You groan.\n\u201cFUCK YOU, YOU GODDAMN PIECE OF SHIT!\u201d he replies back, grabbing his pistol off the table.\n\n Harry then ends your existence by emptying his gun into you.\n", "Do something": "Well there\u2019s nothing stopping you from sending your own exploration detachment teams, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from going yourself either. As far as you know, nobody from the Compound has bothered scouting past Base Pandora, you figure it\u2019s as good of place as any\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay I want two scouting detachments of four. I\u2019m going with one of them. We\u2019re just going to go a few miles from this place and then come back. It\u2019ll give us a better lay of the land in case of an attack and it\u2019ll keep our skills sharp as well. The rest of you guard the base as usual.\u201d\n\nYou half expect Marina to come with you, but she\u2019s content on staying behind to help look after the base. She looks at you admiringly though that you\u2019re taking the initiative. She tells you she loves you and that she can\u2019t wait for you to get back. You like the fact she\u2019s got confidence that you ARE coming back this time around.\n\nYou and your team leave and start exploring. Base Pandora really was in a secluded location, most of your trek is through a small unspoiled woods, eventually you get to the end though after about a day. You notice the Geiger counter is clicking a bit more. Not a lot, but enough to be a little unsettling. Using some binoculars, up ahead you see a single run down farm house (the farm itself also looks run down and hasn\u2019t been up kept in years). Just then you see a few vehicles also approaching up ahead, you tell everyone else to pull back into the woods and keep down while you do likewise. You continue to look as the vehicle park nearby the farm house and figures begin to get out. All of them are wearing robes and carrying automatic weapons over their backs. You also see them dragging what looks to be a few hapless prisoners with them as they enter the structure. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that these folks aren\u2019t the nice type.\n\n\u201cOh shit, these guys look prepared. Who do you think they are?\u201d one of your team asks.\n\u201cHow should I know Reggie? When we moved into Base Pandora it\u2019s not like we got a welcome to the neighborhood letter from every nearby freak within a few miles of us. If I had to guess and judging by the robes, they\u2019re probably some doomsday cult. Probably one that was building up a stock pile of shit even before the bombs hit. Got some interesting vehicles though.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what\u2019re we going to do?\u201d\n\nWhat to do indeed. You definitely need to wipe these cultists out since it\u2019s possible you could have trouble with them in the future if they start wandering in your direction. They also have vehicles that could be of use and probably other supplies as well. You could radio in and wait for reinforcements, but the prisoners you just saw them take in might be dead by then.\n", "Get reinforcements": "It\u2019s a brutal world and it just got more so. Rushing in outnumbered, isn\u2019t likely to save anyone and most likely going to get you killed. You radio in for reinforcements and keep an eye on the farm in the mean time. Later when the darkness comes you see a group of them come out with torches, form a circle in a nearby plain and begin chanting. You count ten of them altogether Soon two more come out with one of the prisoners from earlier. She\u2019s bound, gagged and naked; you know what\u2019s going to come next.\n\nReggie and another one in your team wants to do something, but you insist that they do nothing and to keep quiet. It\u2019s all over soon anyway, as you see them sacrifice the poor girl for whatever outlandish beliefs they hold. You take first watch for the night. The next day your reinforcements arrive\u2026both of them.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? I asked for at least five more people!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, but that other recon group you sent also ran into trouble, in fact two of them are already dead, and we had to send a rescue team to fetch the other two since one has a broken leg.\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cSo should we call this off?\u201d one of you team asks.\n\u201cNo Vivica, we\u2019re going through with it, but we\u2019re going to employ some stealth, they had three prisoners, I get the feeling they\u2019ll be doing the same ceremony they did last night.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going to attack them now then?\u201d\n\u201cNo Leonard, I don\u2019t feel like fighting a bunch of fanatics armed with machine guns in an open plain with no cover. And we can\u2019t just start firing on them from here, we need to wipe them ALL out as quickly as possible without them having a chance the regroup, fortify or any of that shit. We\u2019re gonna sneak into the house and ambush the whole fuckin\u2019 cult while they\u2019re doing their little ceremony.\u201d\n\nYou wait until night and sure enough they all come out like you thought, then come the others with the prisoner. That\u2019s when the six of you quickly sneak through an overgrown field towards the house. You get to the stairs when Reggie and Leonard break off towards the area were the cult is performing their ceremony.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just let them kill another! We can take \u2018em now! They\u2019re off guard!\u201d\n\u201cReggie get the fuck\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nReggie and Leonard begin firing, the fucking idiots aren\u2019t even taking cover, they\u2019re going head long in like they\u2019re stupid ass action heroes. You and the others lay down some cover fire, but it\u2019s not enough. Reggie and Leonard are cut down after killing a whopping ONE cultist and not even saving the hapless girl, who\u2019s shot instantly. The cultists start spreading out, moving forward, and circling around you at the same time, they\u2019re also better shots than you too, as they\u2019re carefully aiming rather than just firing in the general vicinity. After seeing another one of your team members go down, you and the rest fall back into the house itself.\n\nThe inside of the house looks like something out of a horror movie, there are skulls and bones littering it, along with it blood stains everywhere.\n\n\u201cHoly shit! What\u2019ve we gotten ourselves into?\u201d Vivica yells.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, I hear something\u2026like crying\u2026it\u2019s downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the cultists?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s the same plan, they just know about us now, let\u2019s hope we can still get \u2018em in a good ambush.\u201d\n\nYou and your team members spread out in the house, you head down into the basement, which looks more like a small temple layout. You see a young woman in a cage, and when she sees you her eyes fill with hope. You hear the cultists stomping around upstairs and some gunfire, at which point you try to find a good place to hide.\n\nA bunch of footsteps run down the stairs, you wait in anticipation\u2026closer\u2026closer\u2026\n\n\nNOW!\n\nYou pop up from your spot and begin firing, you kill six of them before they can even react, and the remaining two barely get off some wild shots before you splatter them as well. Still breathing heavy among the dead, you finally hear some good news.\n\n\u201cHey! Are you still alive down there?\u201d Vivica shouts.\n\u201cYeah! What\u2019s going on up there?\u201d\n\u201cWe got a few of them, but I think most of them converged on your position though.\u201d\n\u201cOf course they did, I\u2019ve always been popular.\u201d You reply.\n\nYou release the girl in the cage who\u2019s very thankful. She mentions her name is Ophelia and she\u2019s from a place called Ashtown which is far from this place. She says the cultists came storming into her town specifically trying to capture young girls; they took three before they finally were driven away, and unfortunately Ophelia was one of the three. You tell Ophelia your story; she seems to think you\u2019ve got the right idea about going about things.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to tell my people back in Ashtown that we need to start getting better organized as well, and I\u2019ll be sure to tell them all about you and how you rescued me! Maybe we\u2019ll see each other in the future.\u201d\n\nYou and your team search the farm house which just like you thought was stocked with all sorts of goodies. You\u2019re going to have haul some of it back, but you decide that you could also establish another base of sorts here after it was cleaned up. You\u2019d also like to establish more of a relationship with this Ashtown. So you allow Ophelia to take one of the vehicles for her to drive back there, she certainly doesn\u2019t have a problem with that!\n\nBefore heading back you put Vivica in charge of the place and tell her you\u2019ll be sending some more folks to help get this farm up and running. Not bad for a first try.\n\nFour more years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you joined the Compound and things are going fairly well for you, the farm house has been converted into a way point to Ashtown, with which you have good relations with and is now producing food. You are no longer solely dependant on the Compound for supplies which might be just as well\u2026\n\nYou get less and less reports from the Compound itself other than its undergone a name change and due to its inclusion of a few towns now, its called the Combine and the Compound itself is called Fort Justice. You know about how the Colonel has gotten sick and seems to be getting worse as more time passes and how the population rate is growing, but it\u2019s slow. The major theory is the elevated levels of background radiation are probably affecting fertility. (You wonder about yourself and Marina since she hasn\u2019t once gotten pregnant in the five years you\u2019ve been together) There have been more people sent here, mainly because they hear about how great it is in Pandora as opposed to the miserable place Harry has made Fort Justice since he\u2019s been getting freer reign of the place as the Colonel continues to get sicker.\nIn fact you\u2019ve been hearing some disturbing stories from others who have come here recently. Ranging from needlessly violent occupation of towns, sending people on dangerous unnecessary missions to the city, and recruiting desert scum into the Combine! People are saying Harry\u2019s going nuts with power.\n\nOne day, one of your assistants comes in and has something to report.\n\nThe Colonel has died, Harry has taken complete control of the Combine and his first order is for YOU to return to Fort Justice for reassignment.\n\nHarry\u2019s just plain gone completely nuts if he thinks you\u2019re going to do that.\n\nSpeaking of nuts, that same day after you convince everyone in seceding from the Combine you get a radio message from someone who\u2019s been quiet until now.\n\n\u201cWell well, it seems you\u2019ve got a problem on your hands.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Alex. You\u2019re guessing he\u2019s been surviving on rats and roaches down there.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want and how do you know what\u2019s been going on?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you think? I\u2019ve been listening in on all your incoming and outgoing radio transmissions since you betrayed me and trapped me down here! I must say though, you probably did the intelligent thing. And your progress with establishing your own separate territory has been intriguing\u2026but I can tell you right now, you are going to need help with your current problem, a problem I will be willing to help with if you\u2019re willing to talk.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll play. What\u2019re you proposing?\u201d\n\u201cThere are still a lot of those high tech weapons down here that you were coming to get when you came here five years ago. I\u2019m sure they would be very useful in your up coming war with Harry, and don\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t, because I know you aren\u2019t going to run or meekly follow his orders to return. You\u2019ve obviously set your sights on higher ambitions than just following orders and survival. I\u2019ll be willing to give them to you, in exchange for my freedom.\u201d\n\u201cOh that easy huh? How do you propose we go about this? I send people down there to retrieve them while your death machines ambush them as soon as they enter?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be kind of hard for that to happen since all my cyborgs are long dead and my robots have fallen into disrepair\u2026I\u2019m basically alone down here. You were guarding nothing!\u201d Alex laughs.\n\nYou\u2019re pretty skeptical about this little tale, but if it\u2019s true, those weapons would certainly help.\n", "Continue to fight": "\u201cKeep fighting the bastards! Pandora will never fall!\u201d you shout as you mow down another dirt biker.\n\nIn all the fighting though you begin to worry where Marina is, you look around for her in the chaos, and then you see her fighting with multiple enemies converging on her position.\n\nYou rush towards her to back her up and then you\u2019re blown back by an explosion. You slam up against a wall of one of the barracks, other than some minor pain and some scars you\u2019re going to have you aren\u2019t harmed, however your heart is when you see Marina lying bloody on the ground. She isn\u2019t moving. Ignoring everything else you run to her, you kneel down to pick up her body, she grabs weakly on to you, but she\u2019s in bad shape.\n\n\u201cKeep fighting to rebuild civilization\u2026its still worth it\u2026\u201d she says before losing total consciousness.\n\n Alex suddenly comes up to you.\n\n\u201cHey! We got people firing on us; you need to get the fuck outta the open!\u201d\n\u201cYou! You\u2019re a fucking surgeon! You fix her! Save her! Save her NOW!\u201d you shout, picking her up and shoving her into Alex\u2019s arms.\n\u201cWha\u2026I\u2026\u201d Alex realizes you mean fucking business so he just nods and runs with her to one of the few undamaged buildings.\n\nYou\u2019re blind with rage, you begin charging into battle trying take out as many of these motherfuckers as you can, its quite possible with your actions alone you turned the tide, but you are still just one man, and you nearly get yourself killed, if it hadn\u2019t been for Vivica managing to get a few people from Ashtown to help out, and they arrive just in time.\n\nOphelia shoots a Combine soldier who was sneaking up on you. You turn around to see her, you nearly don\u2019t recognize her decked out in battle gear.\n\n\u201cTold you, you\u2019d see me in the future.\u201d She says and runs off to clean up the stragglers running away.\n\nThe Combine is pulling back. You\u2019ve won, but at a high cost.\n\nWhen you return to check on Marina, you find her dead. Alex explains there was nothing he could do for her. You ask to be alone which he complies. You spend the rest of the night alone with Marina\u2019s lifeless body weeping and vowing revenge.\n\n \nThe next day, you come out with one focus. To assault Fort Justice. This will never be over until Harry is dead. You need to strike now when he\u2019s weak.\n\nA lot of people are wondering if you shouldn\u2019t wait to regroup, but you won\u2019t hear of it, you\u2019re determined to do it now and everyone who\u2019s in fighting condition is coming with you.\n\nIn a couple days you and your small army arrive at Fort Justice. You half expect to die this day assaulting the place, but once again destiny is with you. Fort Justice is experiencing a minor authority problem. You can take the scum out of the wasteland, but you can\u2019t make them disciplined soldiers. The last defeat has shattered morale, and apparently some are starting to question Harry\u2019s orders, while others aren\u2019t willing to die for him. The gate is wide open and parts of the place are in flames.\n\nYou walk in relatively unopposed. Some fighting occurs, but you\u2019re looking for Harry and when the loud mouth shithead sees you, instead of confronting you, he runs for the trapdoor to the underground. You immediately run to cut him off and shoot him in both legs. He falls and grabs for his pistol, but you take careful aim and blow his hand off, he screams in pain when he sees his fingers all over the ground.\n\nA kick to his face follows, and then a stomp, and another, and another. You don\u2019t stop until his face looks like tenderized hamburger. He tries to act defiant by trying to give you the finger with his good hand, but you take it and break the motherfucker along with the rest of his hand.\n\n\u201cThis is for Marina and the rest of the deaths you caused.\u201d You say, before blasting his mushy bloody head into mushy bloody pieces.\n\nNow its over.\n\nYou collapse by Harry\u2019s body, spent and drained. Alex goes over to see if you\u2019re alright, but Ophelia tells him to just make sure all the enemy are either dead or running. Ophelia takes you to a barrack and puts you on a bed and tells you to rest, which you do.\n\n\u201cI did it Marina\u2026I got him\u2026\u201d you mumble while falling asleep.\n\nThe next few weeks consist of rebuilding. Rebuilding everything. Fort Justice. Base Pandora. All the damage Harry caused. Word gets out to the Combine occupied towns about their current situation, with no centralized authority figure anymore, the Combine dissipates as wasteland scum flee and return to the outlands where they belong. The townspeople of those places are very grateful for your help, and you\u2019re now in charge of everything but you take no joy in any of it, or anything. You\u2019re numb. You go through the motions, but you\u2019re basically in a daze. All your thoughts are of Marina, you feel empty without her.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for her, you wouldn\u2019t even be alive right now. You would\u2019ve died in a big mushroom cloud death. You start blaming yourself for not being able to save her, you start thinking about suicide. Everyone gets a little worried about you. Vivica starts radioing in wondering about your condition, Alex (Who\u2019s quite familiar with mental breakdowns) attempts to talk to you, but it\u2019s Ophelia who turns you around, though not immediately, but it\u2019s her actions that become the turning point.\n\nLate one night, as you wallow in the emptiness, Ophelia visits you. You expect her to tell you not blame yourself for Marina\u2019s death again, but she doesn\u2019t. Instead she talks about the time when you saved her from the cultists and how grateful she was that day and how she would\u2019ve almost done anything to repay you for saving her life.\n\n\u201cMm\u2026well you repaid it already. You saved mine back at Pandora.\u201d You say wishing to be left alone.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m saving it now.\u201d\n\nOphelia begins to remove her clothing, something that takes you completely by surprise. You feel you shouldn\u2019t, you know you shouldn\u2019t, but maybe it\u2019s feeling of loneliness, maybe it\u2019s the feeling of confusion, or maybe its just plain hormones, and you give in to Ophelia\u2019s advances. And for that one night, the emptiness within you disappears.\n\nThe next day Ophelia is gone leaving you a note saying she\u2019s going back to Ashtown and tells you that you shouldn\u2019t give up on life since you have so much more to change in this new world.\n\nWhen you think about it, Marina saved you, so you could carry that goal out. She always did see the potential in you to do great things.\n\nWith this new perspective, you begin to return to normal, though there still was a little piece of you that died when Marina did. You\u2019ll never completely be the same. Life goes on though.\n\nFive more years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since the bombs dropped and civilization is starting to rebuild itself again\u2026well somewhat.\n\nHard to believe you would\u2019ve become any type of leader trying to rebuild civilization. Marina might not be around anymore, but obviously her influence on you still is and always will be as you follow her dream of rebuilding civilization again.\n\nYou\u2019re still running things from Base Pandora, which is now the unofficial head of the Atomic Alliance. The towns formally under Combine occupation are included, but are now treated as equals rather than glorified labor camps, though getting everyone to agree completely on anything still remains a problem. Fort Justice is now under Vivica\u2019s command and the Farmhouse, now known as Eden is a fully functional agricultural community. (It supplies food as well as biofuel for vehicles now) After that one night with Ophelia you don\u2019t see her anymore, but last you heard she had a baby and got married to someone in Ashtown. Good for her.\n\nOther than political disagreements, everything has been going fairly well; raiders are still a problem, but much less than in the past. For the most part people are pretty happy living in your territory.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s been debated among you and some of other leaders, are the few GZS Shelters the Alliance has stumbled across over recent years. No effort has been made to open them, but they\u2019re all sealed shut by their main computers. From what you know by reading some of the GZS documents found in Base Pandora (and Alex who definitely has some knowledge of GZS protocols) the Shelters weren\u2019t supposed to open up until the central computer determined that sufficient amount of time had passed and the surface deemed safe. Apparently the computers still think the surface sucks. (And that assessment wouldn\u2019t exactly be wrong)\n\nMost of the other Alliance leaders say that some sort of contact should be made with them. You get the impression some of them might\u2019ve done it anyway, it\u2019s just you have most of the equipment that makes it a lot easier.\n"}, "tree": {"The First Page": {"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz": {"Head to work": {"Indulge in the festivities": {"Party like its 1999 (Even though it really is not 1999)": "END", "Get another TV and watch the world die": {"Volunteer": {"Continue with your mission": {"Open fire and run": "END"}}}}, "Go with the cyborg": {"Suggest in hacking the security system, then invading the base.": {"Enter": "END", "Leave": "END"}, "Suggest in containing Alex instead": {"Stay put": {"Leave the Combine": "END", "Secede from the Combine": "END"}, "Do something": {"Get reinforcements": {"Believe Alex": "END", "Continue to fight": "END"}, "Continue to fight": "END"}}}}, "Do something": "END"}}}}, {"title": "Happy(TM)", "stories": {"Happy": "The greatest desire in every man\u2019s heart\n\n\nMore than his longing for riches or art\n\n\nMore than he wishes himself to be king\n\n\nWants more than any material thing\n\n\n \n\nThere\u2019s only one feeling greater than love\n\n\nFamily forgotten in memory of\n\n\nNothing can beat it for nothing compares\n\n\nMore coveted still than water or air\n\n\n \n\nThe greatest desire for all of mankind\n\n\nAll from the dull to the brightest of minds\n\n\nWe covet it more than justice or truth\n\n\nBetter than beauty and better than youth\n\n\n \n\nIt\u2019s why we create and why we destroy\n\n\nAll in the searching and longing of joy\n", "Mike": "It was so nice back in the old days. It was three simple steps and that\u2019s it:\n\n\n\nKindap\n\nTorture\n\nKill\n\n\n\n \n\nThe kidnapping actually got a lot easier after the government shut down and killing got easier too, since nobody puts up a fight anymore. The glaring problem is simple: torture stopped being fun! I used to revel in the screams and pleas of my victims, but ever since HappyCo\u2122 made their Happy\u2122 injection, most everyone has been Happy\u2122 all of the time. Happy\u2122 people don\u2019t feel pain and they don\u2019t care if you tie them down and cut off their digits one by one. I would\u2019ve written HappyCo\u2122 a downright meanspirited letter of complaint if HappyCo\u2122 still existed.\n", "Find unHappy(tm) people": "There was only one thing to do: find someone else who never got the Happy\u2122 injection. I stepped out the front door of my house and headed towards downtown Sugar Land. I had barely left my house since the apocalypse, so I was a bit surprised at how many people I saw. Honestly, I figured most people were dead at this point since Happy\u2122 people forget to feed themselves most of the time. The people around town were all Happy\u2122, just wandering around aimlessly and smiling. I walked up to a middle-aged woman, \u201chow have you been keeping yourself alive all this time?\u201d\n\n\n\nMost Happy\u2122 people are nonverbal but some could still think clearly enough to say a few words. She smiled blankly, \u201ctears,\u201d was all she said. I couldn\u2019t get any more information out of her.\n\n\nI kept walking and finally made it to downtown. I looked carefully at every face I passed but they all wore stupid grins. Suddenly, I heard a loud blood-curdling scream: something Happy\u2122 people never do. I quickly ran towards the noise. In front of the post office were two people, two regular people that is. A man held a woman from behind, a knife to her throat. She wasn\u2019t screaming anymore, but the fear was painted on her face clear as day. The man looked around frantically, like he was looking for someone and the woman seemed to see he was distracted. She started pulling something out of her boot, something shiny. It was a knife! I didn\u2019t know which of them was going to win in a knife fight, but I decided to step in. One of them was going to be my ticket to finding victims, after all.\n", "Help the woman": "I ran up to them as fast as I could and pushed the man down. Once he was down, it was easy to pull the knife away from him. I quickly plunged the knife into his neck, killing him instantly. It felt orgasmic to see the light leave his eyes.\n\n\nI looked at the woman, she was shaking and obviously terrified. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she whimpered.\n\n\nLooking at her, I knew there was no way she was surviving on her own. She had to be part of a group and I just needed to be the good guy to be invited in. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d I said softly, \u201che was going to kill you, I just thought it was my duty to protect a lady.\u201d\n\n\nShe still looked scared but she smiled for a moment. \u201cthank you. Those guys have been hunting us down. I-I don\u2019t know why\u201d She wiped away her tears.\n\n\n \u201cUs?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m with The Egalitarian Apocalypse Rescue Society or T.E.A.R.S. for short. Our mission is to feed all the Happy\u2122 people we can. They may be less than human now, but life is still precious. Do you\u2026agree?\u201d\n", "Join T.E.A.R.S.": "T.E.A.R.S. was a very friendly organization. They were fifteen people strong and apparently originally were a church group that opted out of the mandatory Happy\u2122 injection due to religious objections. Truthfully, I only got out of it by faking my own death.\n\n\nThe headquarters was their old church and they fed Happy\u2122 people through a combination of farming and using old canned food from grocery stores. To not blow my cover, I helped too. It was honestly a nice life, though it was weird to help people instead of killing them. I stayed good for a number of weeks but my appetite for murder was beginning to itch.\n", "Kill them": "It was easy, they were all so gullible. I told them I needed help at the jail and they actually came. Locking all the members in the cells was easy too. Then it was just a matter of torturing and killing them all at my leisure. What an absolute blast.\n", "Give up murder": "I vowed to myself to never kill again. After seeing how kind and generous T.E.A.R.S. was, I couldn\u2019t go back. One day I ate my dinner quietly then got up and went to my room, which doubled as a storage closet. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I had to kill someone but I vowed to never take the life of another again. If I stayed alive, I was going to break and kill the kindest people on Earth. I tied a rope to the ceiling fan, put it around my neck, and kicked away the chair. At last, T.E.A.R.S. was safe.\n", "Help the man": "I ran up to them as fast as I could and pushed the woman down. Once she was down, it was easy to pull the knife away from her. The man just watched, his eyes wide. Then he flashed a quick smile, \u201cdid you just save me?\u201d\n\n\nI looked at him, \u201cI guess so, I was actually looking to take this woman here myself.\u201d I was choking her as I talked. Not long enough to kill, just to make her pass out for a bit. I\u2019d done it so often in my prime that I knew exactly how long and how much pressure was necessary.\n\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked. I looked him over. He was small and scrawny, someone I could easily take in a fight if things got ugly. I decided to just say the truth, not like he could call the cops or anything.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to torture and kill her for my own pleasure. Unless there was some other use you wanted her for.\u201d\n\n\nHe laughed, \u201cno way, dude! That\u2019s what we were gonna do to her! Can\u2019t believe I found a new recruit. I\u2019m part of Sadists Aiding Death, or S.A.D. for short. We track down unHappy\u2122 people and kill them. It\u2019s way easier as a team.\u201d\n", "Join S.A.D.": "I carried the woman while John, the man I saved, led me to S.A.D.\u2019s hideout. Turns out it was the library. S.A.D. was a group of five men, including me, and we were all serial killers. They had a system that was easy enough to stick to. Everyone helped find victims, then we all got a chance to rape and/or torture each victim. We all liked to kill so we took turns being the one to administer the final blow. It seemed like a pretty nice life. Hunting down people with a group, getting to torture and kill to my heart\u2019s content. But then again, killing a group of killers seemed just as attractive.\n", "Stay in S.A.D.": "I decided not to ruin my one chance at comradery in the apocalypse. I stayed with S.A.D. and together we killed every unHappy\u2122 person in the Houston area that we could find.\n", "Kill S.A.D.": "I bided my time carefully and gained their trust. I knew they had numbers on their side so I had to be careful. When I happened upon ketamine one day, I knew I struck gold. I slipped some in their food one night and they passed out hard. I tied them up in separate rooms of the library. The next week was the best of my entire life. I cut off body parts and cauterized them until there was nothing more to cut off without killing them. After that, I knew I couldn\u2019t wait any longer, the urge was too strong. Their jugulars felt like butter on my knife.\n", "Kill more Happy(TM) people": "I walked out my front door and looked around. It wasn\u2019t too long until I found a nice family of four. They had been my neighbors, a very nice couple with two young sons. I threw all four of them in my basement. It\u2019s a nice, soundproof little room with a boombox and a complete set of surgical tools. They were all Happy\u2122. I threw the gauntlet at them: mutilation, waterboarding, starvation, and castration for two weeks. They all wore stupid grins the whole time. At that point, I didn\u2019t even feel like killing them. I walked up to the matriarch of the family. \u201cSusan, what are you going to do if I kill your son?\u201d She didn\u2019t even look at me; she just smiled blankly at the ground. She had it bad, worse than most.\n\n\nI grabbed a sharp knife from my toolset and walked up to the youngest son. He was around 7, maybe 8. I was tired of the games and figured I should just end it. The question was: how?\n", "Cut the ropes": "I cut the ropes that tied up all four of my victims but they didn\u2019t move an inch. They just smiled aimlessly. I had amputated both legs of Paul, the father of the family, so him not moving was expected but the other three didn\u2019t have any excuses. Missing fingers and toes were no reason not to run away. \u201cGet out of here!\u201d I yelled roughly.\n\n\nThe older son, Mark, looked at me momentarily but still didn\u2019t move. I supposed they thought it was easier to do nothing. I knew I didn\u2019t want them in my basement so I grabbed Mark and threw him over my shoulder, walked up the stairs leading back into my laundry room, walked to the entry, then out the front door. I dropped Mark on the street in front of my house, then did the same for his brother, mother, and father.\n", "Hungry": "I went back in my house and grabbed one of the cans of soup I stole from the grocery store after they all shut down. I ate it cold, there was no electricity anymore and I didn\u2019t feel like starting a fire. I thought long and hard about my situation. My house had enough provisions to survive me at least another 10 years or so thanks to a canned food stockpile and well water. There was only one problem: my hunger for murder.\n", "Cut their necks": "I grabbed the little boy\u2019s hair with my right hand and pulled up so I could get a better view of his pale neck. I gently place the knife against his jugular then quickly dug it in and sliced his neck open. He fell to the ground, dead within moments. None of his family even blinked. They didn\u2019t care when I cut open their necks either. Red stained the floor and my knife was dripping scarlet blood. For the first time, it didn\u2019t make me feel good. Apathy is quite boring. I used to go to great lengths with dismembering bodies and hiding them but after the apocalypse, murder wasn\u2019t illegal anymore. I grabbed the bodies one by one and dumped them in the woods near my house, not wanting to smell the rotting corpses.\n"}, "tree": {"Happy": {"Mike": {"Find unHappy(TM) people": {"Help the woman": {"Join T.E.A.R.S.": {"Kill them": "END", "Give up murder": "END"}}, "Help the man": {"Join S.A.D.": {"Stay in S.A.D.": "END", "Kill S.A.D.": "END"}}}, "Kill more Happy(TM) people": {"Cut the ropes": {"Hungry": {"Find unHappy(tm) people": "END"}}, "Cut their necks": {"Hungry": "END"}}}}}}, {"title": "Hive Mind", "stories": {"The Awakening": "6:00 PM\n\nYou are Ben Smith, a simple white-collar office worker in New York City.

It is called, \"The Light.\" When fired, it fires a strange beam of entertwining rays around a powerful shot of pure light. It spans out in random directions. You put it on your back, thinking it may be useful.\n\nSuddenly, you hear screams from Times Square. You rush up to the roof, and see something amazing and terrifying at the same time.\n\nThe Giant Squid.\n\nYou wonder how it is even here, because it needs to be in water. It doesn't seem to notice, though, as it slaps down on running people, crushing lives and buildings. You pull out your gun and fire it at the creature.\n\nThe random beams seem to focus on the squid, obliterating it into a thousand bits of light energy.

I have always liked the mornings, the minutes before Teacher takes me to father and I have time to think for myself. Father often keeps a tight schedule so there usually isn't much time for me to let my mind ponder. There are so many things to think about, what is behind the door? What do Homo Sapiens look like? Why does Teacher have to connect himself to a power source every now and then? As curious I am about the outside world, father has explained how dangerous the Homo Sapiens can be, so I am glad the door keeps them away. Father says me and Eve are special, I wonder what he means by that. He said he'd explain more today, I hope he does.\n\nTeacher enters the room and says \"Adam, Professor Meckard would like to see you.\"\n\n\"Wonderful. Father will hopefully answer some of our questions.\" I say and leave with Teacher.\n\nTeacher is made of metal, just like the walls. I think father made Teacher, just like he made our home, along with me and Eve. Teacher signals me to wait as he goes into Eve's room to wake her up. Father often calls me and Eve the last hope for a good future, but I really don't see anything bad with the present. He has talked about something he calls Project Eden, but again, just another unanswered question\n", "Father.": "Soon Eve comes out of her room. We look at one another, smile and say \"good morning\". Teacher takes us to father's office. It is strange that Teacher calls him Meckard and not father, he created him as well, so he is his father just as he is ours. We enter father's room and sit down in front of the desk. As usual, father has his gaze completely set on some paper he has in front of him. I see the title of the page \"Pandora's Box\", but then father puts it away and looks at us.\n\n\"Adam, Eve, do you know what day it is today?\"\n\n\"No.\" We both say.\n\n\"Today is exactly ten years since you came into this world. That is what is called a birthday. It is a human tradition, one of the few that actually deserve to live on. It is where an individuals existence is celebrated every day that is exactly a year from the last birthday, starting with the day he is created.\"\n\n\"We are celebrating today?\"\n\n\"Well, I am afraid Teacher won't be baking a cake, but I hope to make today a special day for you.\"\n\nIt was going to be special alright, but not in the manner any of us were hoping for.\n", "Playing 20 questions.": "\"But yesterday, I promised to answer some of your questions.

Well, Homo Sapiens are your primitive anchestors, and my race. Yes, I am a Homo Sapien, but a rare one. Most of them are violent, ignorant and stubborn. With you, I hope to make existence perfect.

Such an occurrence is rare, and they are glad so few people know about this lake, for if they did, this place would surely be overcrowded.\n\nMrs. Cordan sees something plummet into the lake. It fell down the small waterfall that connects the river to the lake. She tells her husband about it but he says it's probably just a rock. She claims it's too big to be a rock and eventually, he agrees to check it out. They approach the lake and mr. Cordan grabs something from the lake. It is a large rock. He tells mrs. Cordan than she's being too paranoid, but this thing he has in his hands starts to change. The shell giving the illusion that it is a rock starts to de-grow and it reveals an infant child.\n", "Gorgon high school.": "17 years have passed. Mr. and mrs.

He is now Ralph Cordan, just one of the students at the Gorgon high school, and one of the students disappointed with his grade.\n\n\"What bullshit it this? I studied for five hours straight for that test and you're telling me I get a D?\" Ralph shouts at his teacher.\n\n\"I graded you according to your answers Ralph, not according to your efforts. but since you didn't even know that Gorgon city was founded by germans, I doubt you even studied for this test.\"\n\nWith that said, the teacher leaves Ralph to his own frustration.\n", "Introducing the villain.": "The teacher approaches her car in the underground parking lot. It is dark and quiet. One of the more scary places in the school. She attempts to open her door, but notices that it is completely gone. Something has ripped the door from the hinges of the car. She notices Ralph behind her.\n\n\"Oh Ralph, you scared me.\"\n\n\"Did I?\"\n\n\"Can you believe this? The entire door is missing? I knew the city's criminals were desperate, but what could they do with a door?\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised what some people can do\"\n\nA bone spike starts to grow from Ralph's wrist and forms a dagger.\n", "Introducing the hero.": "Four months have passed since the battle at the lighthouse.

Me and Eve were created and genetically altered by my father, professor Henry Meckard to be the perfect human beings, or the Homo Perfectuses. He had always talked about how we would bring brightness to the world as the evil and corrupted Homo Sapiens would fall before us, but I was too young at the time to fully understand what he meant. The difference between the Homo Perfectuses and the Homo Sapiens, is the fact that a portion of our DNA is tangible, or bendable. This gives us the ability to manipulate our own DNA and change our genetic structure, making us stronger, faster, smarter, even warmer. We have to be careful with this power, as messing with the DNA can be dangerous, even lethal. Like Meckard said, the DNA is like a rubber band, it can be bent, but bend it too much and it breaks.\n\nAs we were practicing our powers, Eve had an accident, she almost bent her DNA too much, reaching the fourth level of five, five being death. This left me alone in the facility, at the same time that a stranger knocked on the front door. I didn't know what it could be, as I had never seen anything from the outside world, but my curiosity forced me to open the door. A nearly dehydrated man collapsed before me and Meckard took him away, but not until I took a book called the Bible from the man. I started reading the Bible, and five years later, I knew it like the back of my hand. But it raised a lot of questions. This started a kind of a rebellion within me that lead to me suspecting Meckard of lying. I tried to investigate further, and found out that he intended to kill off humanity with a virus he had developed, called Pandora's Box. Meckard found out that I ad been snooping around, and after I had grabbed a tape with research footage on Pandora's Box, I ran.\n\nAfter crossing the entire desert, I found myself in a dirt, gritty human city, called Gorgon city. There, I tried to find a way to view the tape I had stolen, but finding a VHS machine was extremely tough. I found an ally though, a human named Mark. He worked at an electronic store, and his knowledge of human technology was of great benefit to me. He helped me find a VHS, and we found out that Pandora's Box was active, but it wasn't airborne. It was however waterborne, and as I had left Meckard with limited options, he would try to go along with his plan despite the fact that his virus couldn't spread in the air. I found out that he intended to use Eve to dry up the ocean, causing an intense downpour on the entire earth that he would use to have his virus reach every human on the planet.\n\nI got there in time to stop Meckard, but he sent Eve do battle me. Realizing I had no other way to save humanity, I was forced to fight the person I was created to love. I couldn't kill her, so I froze her, using her vulnerability to cold, but exposing me to my vulnerability to heat as well. I was left burned, but I managed to drag myself to face Meckard. He explained to me that he was trying to kill of the human society and not just the humans, but that didn't change my motives. I injected him with the entire virus, hoping that it's large quantity would overpower his antivirus and kill him off once and for all. He did start to disintegrate, but in a surprise move, he lounged for the ocean to spread his infection. I managed to cut the infected water away from the rest of the ocean, and froze the infected water with Meckard in it, ending this struggle.

Apparently, the child is a 100% Homo Perfectus, but I never got the story behind that. Bringing the child's father up seemed to make her sad, so I never asked.\n\nI've noticed some new members there too. A plant-human hybrid that goes by the name Grove, an android, or an armored individual called Hyper, and Jonathan Skage. Eve always did try to make his mental state fit enough to join the Imperfects in her frequent visits to the Isolation, and I guess that worked.\n\nFreakshow is still with his girlfriend, Gabrielle.

That seems to be what they're calling me: Karma. Most people have no idea what it is that attacks criminals in the night, but they're definately talking about it, forming theories. This is good, this is very good. If everyone starts to believe this is a natural phenomenon that strikes criminals at all times, then perhaps, my work will be over, and people will stop inflicting pain onto others that they themselves don't want to endure. It is also good that people are confused whether it is a force of good or a force of evil. I don't want people to get the misconception of me being evil, but this way, people might fear me while still acknowledge me as beneficial to the society.\n\nI put the newspaper back to where it was, and then start to channel myself through Europe, picking up on everything that's going on there at once, aside from that which is illuminated of course. I usually encounter a lot of violence when I channel myself through such a large area at once. Much justice to be distributed. In Spain, I see a mugger, taking a man's wallet. I don't return the wallet yet. I wait for him to return home, and see that his apartment has been stolen, literally. I am still careful to leave enough of a foundation for the rest of the building not to crash, and then I slowly channel the wallet back to its rightful owner. Everytime the mugger tries to grab the wallet, floating in the air, I inflict great pain to his hand.\n\nAt the same time, the bullet fired by a hit-man in France goes back and pierces through his head, and a man trying to hijack a plain moves, unfortunately for him, into a shadowed area, and gets thrown out of the plain. At least he lands where he wanted to go. However, when I channel myself into Novarra, I find a peculiar scenario, where men, marked as government agents, are attacking an unarmed woman. I channel myself there, but she project a telekinetic wave from her body that knocks the attackers away. One of them stands up, and then sees my eyes. He aims his gun at me and yells \"Stay put mutant!\"\n\n\"Your bullet does nothing, but show hostility, and you will receive the same\" I say. The man shoots at me anyway, and the bullet just goes through me. As I had warned, I then crush his gun into an orb and smack him with it, knocking him unconscious.\n", "Leksiah.": "\"What is your name?\" I ask the woman as she stands up and she looks at my eyes.\n\n\"I...thank you. My name is Leksiah.\"\n\n\"Leksiah? Is that Novarran?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"These men, they work for the government, don't they?\"\n\nShe nods and I then add \"why were they after you?\"\n\nIn response, Leksiah levitates the orb I bent the gun into and lifts it in between us. She then fixes it, forming the original gun from it.\n\n\"You are telekinetic then?\"\n\nShe nods again.\n\n\"But you still didn't tell me what these men wanted from you.\"\n\n\"That was why. I am telekinetic.\"\n\n\"What? They were trying to kill you because of your abilities?\"\n\n\"Well, they were just going to lock me up, but I refused, and so they started shooting.\"\n\n\"But why were they going to lock you up?\"\n\n\"You don't watch politics much, do you?\"\n\n\"I can pay attention to a lot of things, but what happens in every single government in every single country is not easy, especially since I just visit at night-time.\"\n\n\"Well...you heard about the monster attack in Endrun, a few months ago?\"\n\n\"I did. It was unfortunate that it was at day time. Otherwise I could have helped.\"\n\n\"Well, everyone in Novarra has been afraid of...of freaks ever since\" she says and looks down.\n\n\"You mean mutants.\"\n\n\"Is there a difference?\"\n\n\"A man killed two thousand people once trying to answer that question.\"\n\n\"Well, recently, there were presidential elections here, and one of the candidates, named Philias Unon took advantage of the fear people had of fre...of people like me, and so he promised to make everyone safe. This is him, fulfilling his promise.\"\n\n\"What? People are incarcerated for being victims of genetic alterations?\"\n\nLeksiah nods, and I freeze one of the agents, as he tries to stand up. This sort of thing, taking people's freedom, not just for being different, but for being someone else's victim really gets on my bad side.\n", "Kill the agents.": "These people, think they can just take other people's freedom, even though they've done nothing to deserve anything on that scale. These people, like this Leksiah, deserve to keep their freedom, and for attacking that, these men don't even deserve their lives, so I tear out their hearts and place them in their hands, where they look upon them before collapsing motionless to the ground.\n\nLeksiah approaches me and asks \"You...you are that Karma thing I keep reading about?\"\n\n\"Among other things.\"\n\n\"Do you...do you have a name?\"\n\n\"My creators named me Baryon, so I guess that's my name.\"\n\n\"Your creators?\"\n\n\"Yes. As you can no doubt see, I am one of the 'freaks' as well. I am made of dark-matter, and my power is only limited by the amount of light I am exposed to. That's it in a nutshell.\"\n\n\"How...what's your story?\"\n\n\"The full story? My mother was killed while pregnant with me, carved open and then, when they had removed the embryo that would later develop into a happy little boy, they fed her to a cannibalistic mutant and grew me in a tub full of dark-matter, only to issue my project as flawed. How's that for a bed-time story?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't...\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. What about you? Telekinesis doesn't just spring from nowhere, does it?\"\n\n\"Well, I am the results of a man's attempt to heighten human intelligence.\"\n\n\"So you are hyper-intelligent?\"\n\n\"Yes, sort of. I know I haven't forgotten anything I experienced since my escape four months ago.\"\n\n\"And the telekinesis?\"\n\n\"Not sure. The containments were not sufficiently equipped to defend against telekinesis, so I imagine it was an unforseen side-effect of whatever it is they did to my mind.\"\n\n\"You were kidnapped then? Before that you had a normal life?\"\n\n\"Yes. I did. I even had a family until they called those agents after the law was initiated.\"\n\n\"That...I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. But...are you going to do something about this whole thing? This law?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll have to do something. I can't just sit by and watch as people are being put behind bars just for being different.\"\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do?\"\n", "They deserve better.": "\"There are innocent people being arrested? Just for being mutants?\"\n\n\"They claim it's because of the damage they can cause.\"\n\n\"They're not even given the chance to prove them wrong. They deserve more, they deserve to be free. I am going to free them.\"\n\n\"Can...can I come with you?\" Leksiah asks me.\n\n\"You want to come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. To them, we're just freaks, to them, we are the same. This is my fight too, and if we fight it together, then perhaps we can give them a message that if they want to take on one of us, they'll have to take on all of us. We mutants have to stick together, have each other's backs.\"\n", "Teammate.": "\"I'm not going to stop you, so sure, you can come along. Can you keep up?\"\n\nLeksiah closes her eyes and starts to concentrate. She then begins to float over the ground, and levitates herself further up. However, I can feel her mind hurting, and she is forced to let go of herself. She falls down, but I keep her from landing on the ground.\n\n\"Nice, but if you're going to come along, I'll have to take you with me.\"\n\nLeksiah nods, and then she asks \"Do you know where the prison is?.\"\n\nAfter channeling myself around the entire country, I say \"I do now.\"\n"}, "tree": {"A vengeful god.": {"Continue.": {"Examine a newspaper.": {"Speak to the woman.": {"Kill the agents.": {"Free the imprisoned mutants.": {"Let Leksiah come with you.": {"Enter the Novarran prison.": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Homo Perfectus 8", "stories": {"Gender.": "Select the gender for your main character.\n\n\n \n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The first letter.": "Select the first letter in your character's name.\n\n \n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The second letter.": "Your name is currently A.\n\nChoose the second letter in your character's name, or click the link to Chapter 1-Prologue to begin.\n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The third letter.": "Your name is currently Aa.\n\nChoose the third letter in your character's name, or click the link to Chapter 1-Prologue to begin.\n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The fourth letter.": "Your name is currently Aaa.\n\nChoose the fourth letter in your character's name, or click the link to Chapter 1-Prologue to begin.\n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The fifth letter.": "Your name is currently Aaaa.\n\nChoose the fifth letter in your character's name, or click the link to Chapter 1-Prologue to begin.\n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n", "The sixth letter.": "Your name is currently Aaaaa.\n\nChoose the sixth letter in your character's name, or click the link to Chapter 1-Prologue to begin.\n\n\nYOUR HEALTH: 100%\n"}, "tree": {"Male": {"A": {"a": {"a": {"a": {"a": {"a": "END", "b": "END", "c": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Homo Perfectus: Mind Games", "stories": {"Select Gender": "Select your character's gender.\n", "First Letter.": "Select the first letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is .\n", "Second Letter.": "Select the second letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is A.\n", "Third Letter.": "Select the third letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is Aa.\n", "Fourth Letter.": "Select the fourth letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is Aaa.\n", "Fifth Letter.": "Select the fifth letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is Aaaa.\n", "Sixth Letter.": "Select the sixth letter in your character's name.\n\n\nYour character's name is Aaaaa.\n", "Choice": "I just stand there and look at the factory.\n\n\n\"Don't want to do it?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know what I want.\"\n\n\n\"You can choose whatever you want.\"\n"}, "tree": {"Male": {"A": {"a": {"a": {"a": {"a": {"a": "END", "b": "END", "c": "END", "d": "END", "e": "END"}, "Stay outside.": {"Go in through the front door.": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "I Don't Need Air to Breathe", "stories": {"A bright light, an old bed, and a creepy warehouse.": "The light above gleams and sparkles brightly. You look towards it, which is entirely meaningless as you aren't able to avoid its' sharp glare. It beckons you, practically begs for you to move towards it. So you do, you lean up - almost like you're floating into the void, and then you bump your head right against the lamp you were facing.\n\n\n\"Oh! Good evening, didn't expect you to be awake so soon!\"\n\n\nAn overweight woman wearing scrubs and a white apron turns back towards you. You lie on your back on a dingy old cot, and the sharp blare of the white lamp is right in your face. You remember where you are - home. \n\n\n\"Sorry about the lamp! Late night maintenance. Didn't think your light receptors were already up to par! We'll make sure it doesn't happen again in the future.\"\n\n\nYou nod towards Shirley. This woman has been your caretaker since those men put you together, she has always been so nice to you. So why does today feel so... different? You feel a slight bit of anger towards her. Your systems don't quite tell you why. Before you have time to ajnalyze it too much, two men open the door to your bright room. They wear matching black suits with white dress shirts underneath, and dull black ties. The only distinction between them is that one of them has darker skin then the other. They march in before the more pale man asks Shirley,\n\n\n\"What's going on? Why is she awake? We didn't count on her being up right now.\"\n\n\nThe darker skinned man keeps his gaze fixed on you. A quick analysis tells you that both men are armed. The man who is fixated on you has a heartbeat of about 120 bpm at the moment and looks to be in a state of raised anxiety. Your analysis begins piecing more of this puzzle together. Shirley responds,\n\n\n\"I'm not sure. I was running some basic maintenance to make sure her systems were running fine, I think she's developing further. Her light receptors never made her wake up in the past, it seems they've developed further.\"\n\n\nThe darker-skinned man continues to keep his eyes on you as the other one continues to prod. However, he leans in to Shirley to make sure you can't hear what he's about to say, his heartbeat almost matches the other mans', he is also beginning to sweat. Unfortunately for him, you can hear every word.\n\n\n\"Well, can you put her back to sleep? It's not safe to have her up right now. We're the only ones here tonight, it was expected she'd stay down till morning shift came in, we're horribly ill equipped right now, she needs to be asleep.\"\n\n\nShirley looks back towards you with remorseful eyes before whispering back to him.\n\n\n\"Yes, I'll administer more of the anesthetic. That has been working so far, and none of my studies suggest that she has developed any form of resistence to this yet. Stay with me while I try it, just to be safe.\"\n\n\nShe turns back towards you, and in a louder voice attempts to calm your worries,\n\n\n\"Sorry dear! Just discussing some technical details, I'll be with you shortly!\" \n\n\nYour systems begin to analyze further. There were never too many people around you as it stood, but you had also never been awake at this time before. This time they seemed to be caught off guard by your sudden awakening, and their raised anxiety suggests that they're not comfortable with your presence right now.\n\n\nThe man turns back towards your caretaker, and in yet another whisper, asks:\n\n\n\"Do you believe she's ready? We've already managed to pull off several miracles here, if we're able to come through with this project, this could be massive breakthrough.\"\n\n\nShirley nods her head before whispering back,\n\n\n\"Yes. I think we're on the verge here. Perhaps weeks, maybe days at best. We're so close to making this a reality!\" \n\n\nThe man smiles and his heartbeat begins to slow down a bit - as your analysis tells you. He nods and nudges his partner, causing him to relax a bit too. Shirley turns back towards you and begins to walk back.\n\n\n\"Sorry about that, hun! Unimportant matters, no need to bore you with the details. But how about we get you back to bed? We have a busy day tomorrow, you need to be well-rested!\"\n\n\nYou nod towards her, though your system begins to rattle. You don't feel much, but in this case the uneasiness is difficult to ignore. Something about tonight feels different to you. Shirley grabs a mask off the table and walks back towards you. \n\n\n\"Okay, we're just gonna put this on you, it'll calm you down and soothe you back into your rest! It'll be painless, as usual!\" \n\n\nShe smiles at you. Her smile is so beautiful, so warming. Almost... fake. Your analysis tells you that she's still in a state of heightened anxiety which only grows more and more as she eases ever closer to you. Her hand is only inches away from your face, but right before she is able to place the mask over your mouth, something inside you tells you to stop this. You shoot your left hand out and press your thumb and index finger against her throat. The data you were filled with explained every minute detail of human anatomy, and how to kill a person in seconds. This comes in handy as you press your fingers down as hard as your slightly-enhanced strength lets you. Her face gasps in utter horror, but before she's even able to scream out of shock, the nerves in her throat are punctured and she collapses to the floor. Both men immediately reach to the left sides of their waists, which is where your analysis earlier told you their guns were. One of them screams,\n\n\n\"Hey! Put her down, hurry!\"\n\n\nBut before either man can pull out their gun, your enhanced reflexes react and you leap forward off your bed. With both hands sticking forward, the holes in your fingertips emit power sonic waves that send them both flying back into the wall. Both men hit with a loud thud and hit the ground. Your radar senses they both still have heartbeats, but are in massive pain. You straighten yourself out; the nasty bedsuit they put you in makes it uncomfortable to move around. A feeling inside you tells you that you need to act quickly and put both men down without haste. So you approach the one that your scan suggests is less damaged by your prior blow, the darker skinned man. He looks up at you but can barely move as you march over to him. \n\n\n\"Wait, please. No!\"\n\n\nThe first time you have analyzed legitimate human emotion from any of these men, and it comes to a quick end as you shove your knee into his throat, squishing it between you and the wall behind him. His heartbeat disappears. The other man is unconscious, but it's not permanent. Something that needs to change. This one is a lot easier to deal with. No human emotion in him whatsoever as you reach down, grab his jaw with one hand and hold the back of his head with the other before you snap it to the side easily, stopping his heartbeat as well.\n\n\n-------- \n\n\nYou look around at the place that you have called home for what your systems suggest is nearing two years now. Since those men... created you? You're unsure of your creation, but you know that this place causes you to feel rage and displeasure. You believe the best bet here is to make this place no longer exist. You have plenty of knowledge on how to cause fires and believe that it would be the best method to utilize here. You look over at the outlet the lamp above your bed is plugged into and Shirley's water bottle on her desk. You pick up the bottle and cause a small rip in the cable plugging into the outlet. You pour the water slowly - and suddenly the outlet nearby blows. Smoke begins to come out and a fire follows. Though the building is prepared with fire-safety equipment, the water that begins to shoot from the ceiling only makes the electrical fire worse, as it begins to burn through. You realize you need to get out of here.\n\n\nWith no one guarding the door, you march right out of it. You have no idea where to go, but this large warehouse isn't very difficult to navigate. You follow escape exit signs and your system is able to navigate the rest from there fairly easily. The empty building continues to fill with smoke, but you've already made it to the front door. You walk by many offices and areas that you have never seen before - the only areas of the facilities you've seen have been backroom ones, and you admire how much effort went into making the front area of this place look presentable. With one more glance into your old home, you march out into the night, feeling the fresh air hit your flesh for the first time ever. An odd feeling of nostalgia hits you, though you don't entirely recognize this feeling. \n\n\n \n\n \n", "Continue": "A few years ago\n\n\nA gloomy afternoon at the cemetary adds to the atmosphere and the feelings people are sharing right now. A grassy park-like area makes your gravestone feel a little less dim. The name reads \"Lauren Perez - beloved daughter, wife, and friend to many.\" Your relatives sat in the front for the funeral, your husband, Jared, wore that nice suit he hated wearing. Friends, family, coworkers, even people you hadn't seen in quite some time. Since you were a kid, maybe. All lined up, sharing their feelings about you. Your mother hasn't stopped sobbing since she woke up from her two hour sleep last night. Even your father - the one who never showed any emotion - sheds a few tears as he looks at the big framed picture placed above your burial site. His little girl who grew up to be such a great young woman. And now she's gone. \n\n\n------- \n\n\nIt all happened so quickly. You were driving home from the office, so distracted by that big case you were studying as an intern. Thoughts flew threw your mind as you did anything you could to try and find a way to get this poor man off for a crime you are sure he didn't commit, something that could help out the lawyer you were shadowing. The thoughts didn't last long as that green light approached. So did the drunk driver. This area was notorious for these types, but this was also the only internship you could land right out of college. You zoomed into that intersection - and so did he. The collision rattled your brain hard enough to cause you to die almost instantly. \n\n\n-------\n\n\nBack at your funeral, your wonderful husband gives a speech. He approaches the microphone with tears in his eyes. He tries to speak but the saliva in his throat from crying chokes him out for a second. He tries to compose himself for a second before attempting that again. Even with tears in his green eyes, he is still so handsome. He wasn't the tallest guy around, but his pretty face, his pale skin, blonde hair, and sense of style was so appealing to you. He finally begins to speak, \n\n\n\"Lauren.. erm. My Lauren. I can't even put into words how much I miss you. Always thinking you could go and save everyone, always putting others over yourself. She was the greatest person I ever met. It took us some time to come together, but when it finally happened I was the happiest person alive. We had just started our life together.\"\n\n\nHe begins to shake a bit but tries to keep himself together.\n\n\n\"...and we were going to be parents. We didn't tell anyone because we weren't ready. But Lauren was pregnant.\" \n\n\nYour mother begins to sob again, and so does your husband.\n\n\n\"We were going to be parents. She would have been a great mother, and now that's been taken away.\"\n\n\n-------\n\n\nThe paramedics arrived immediately. They took your body out of the wreckage of the car and did everything they could to resuscitate you. It was to no avail as they careful put you on that stretcher and drove you to the ambulence. They sped through the streets as fast as they could, but even once they arrived at the hospital and hooked you up on all sorts of machinery, there was no recovering from that. Jared had rushed down as fast as he could. The waiting room felt like purgatory for him as he waited several hours, only to be told you were gone, and so was the tiny thing inside you. They didn't let him see you, citing that your corpse had been so mangled and torn apart that it'd cause him great pain psychologically to see the mess you were at this point.\n\n\nYour body was meant to be sent to the morgue down below, to be prepared for burial. Then those men arrived. Men in suits. The mortician shook hands with them as he let them in. They took your ice cold corpse in an instant, not wasting any time as they replaced you with what seemed like a decently-made mannequin. \n\n\n------\n\n\nBack at your funeral - a closed casket funeral - as they said they couldn't do anything to fix you up properly for a viewing. Something your family likely gave sighs of relief to, who wants to see their loved ones lying lifelessly anyway? \n\n\nJared continues his speech,\n\n\n\"But we can't keep living this way. It's been several weeks since I got that dreadful phone call. Since my entire life came crumbling down before me. I imagine a lot of you feel the same way.\"\n\n\nHe turns down towards your mother and gives her a sympathetic gaze.\n\n\n\"But Lauren wouldn't want this. She was strong. She was caring, she loved all of us and would hate to see us in this state of despair and helplessness. She would want us to be strong. So we need to be, for her. We need to keep pressing forward. It'll take some time of course; months, days, years. However long it may take each one of us, we can't let this end our lives too. We need to recover, we need to rebuild. And honor her legacy in the way that she would want us to. Thank you all for coming.\" \n\n\nJared steps away from the microphone. He's always been an introvert, never good at giving speeches in front of crowds. The amount of strength it took for him to give that speech must have been tremendous. He never felt very comfortable around your family, or some of your friends, but he did his best. He marches off, not wanting to interact with anyone else. Everyone else begins to collect themselves as they let his words sink in. Some of them are still in shock at the revelation that you were pregnant - especially your mother, who now realizes she was going to be a grandmother. As well as your father, who feels the same. The cloudy afternoon gets cloudier for those who chose to go. Jared is long gone, but everyone else continues to console each other. \n\n\n------\n\n\nThe men in suits drove you off quickly, to a labratory nearby. This was Los Angeles, afterall. There were plenty of locations nearby for whatever they were planning. One of them speaks up,\n\n\n\"Do you think this might actually work?\"\n\n\nThe other responds,\n\n\n\"I don't know. This is the third trial. The first two showed promise. We can't afford to keep failing though, they're cracking hard down on this op. But if we were to have a breakthrough with this one, we'd go down in history. This one seems to fit a perfect profile for our test subject too - young, healthy, fit. Died from blunt force trauma to the skull - all other organs intact and healthy. Not a donor. Unfortunate event though, seems she was a few months pregnant. Always a shame to lose two lives like this.\"\n\n\nThe first man jabs back,\n\n\n\"Hey. If we can accomplish this, who knows how many more lives we could save!\"\n\n\nThe other man gets a more stern look on his face.\n\n\n\"Or destroy.\"\n\n\nThe van approaches the old warehouse in the more ignored part of Los Angeles. They exit the car and quickly carry your corpse out of the vehicle, into the night air, and in through the front door, not wanting to be spotted by anyone. You weren't even gone for a day and you've already made a whole trip around the city! The men are met by a few other people who await them in the lobby of the warehouse. \n\n\n\"We got one. Super fresh, she just passed a few hours ago. Our connections made sure the process was quick and informed me that this was a perfect subject for our tests.\"\n\n\nAnother man approaches, this one wears a full military uniform and seems to be well respected. A Sargeant.\n\n\n\"Alright. That's good news. Not for her, but for us. Now listen here. These past two failures have led to higher ups giving up on this operation. I still believe in it, which is why I've gotten all of you here. Because of the nature of this mission, we need to keep it as covert as possible. Which means we're going to be short staffed around here. Six of you on daytime duty, four of you on noon, two of you on night duty. Mrs. Nance, please step up.\"\n\n\nShirley steps up, wearing her scrubs.\n\n\n\"I'm going to need you to practically live here for the next few years. I need to know you're ready for this. Your husband was very loyal to us and believed in this operation. We're going to honor his memory by making this happen. You've been a great ally to this so far, but this will be your true calling. When we begin to develop her, you're going to need to be her caretaker for a bit. You will practically be her mother. You always wanted kids, well here's your chance!\"\n\n\nShirley smiles, that sweet smile.\n\n\n\"Yes sir. Of course I'm in. Do you think this one will work?\"\n\n\nThe Saregeant looks at his group of 13 people, before commenting.\n\n\n\"I have a good feeling. The last two weren't nearly up to par as test subjects. It was foolish to have tried. This one seems to tick all our boxes. We need to get to work immediately though. Start now, we can't afford to waste time.\"\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~\n\n\nSo time went on. The first few days were rocky. As they 'repaired' your brain by replacing it with microchips. A powerful processor not known to the average citizen. Top secret technology. They replaced a lot of your organs, ripping out bones, replacing some of them with steel and iron.\n\n\n\"Keep the flesh\"\n\n\nOne laments,\n\n\n\"She needs to fit in for our ops. She needs to look as realistic as possible. Do your best to put her back together.\"\n\n\nThey kept some organs. Your heart, parts of your brain that still worked, some other internal organs that you'd still need to function. And after a matter of months, you were ready to be powered on. Those sharp jolts of electricity, zapping at your body over and over. You woke up surrounded by every man on this operation. The data they inputted in your brain began to feed you narratives that these men were to be respected and listened to. Especially the Sargeant. Shirley's sweet, old lady face was engrained in your memories. Everything else had been wiped clean. The Sargeant speaks up first.\n\n\n\"Hello, Diana. Welcome to the world. We are the people who created you. We will be training you as the months and maybe years go by. You will be developed here, this is your home. In time, you will be ready. You will aid our boys on the battlefield through covert operations and expert analysis. You have been gifted a supercomputer for a brain, but you need time to develop it, and training to master it. Your skills will come naturally as you are trained for war by our best in this facility. I'll be here to monitor you, and you will rest at night for proper maintenance. We still have a lot of work to do, so I hope you're ready. You will be an amazing creation.\"\n\n\nSo the months went by. You practiced outside with those lovely men. The routine was the same. Data injection followed by a proper training of that data. You learned to analyze your surrounds using the technology in your body, how to maim, hurt, kill. You were gifted weapons even the military themselves hadn't been able to utilize themselves! Sonic waves from tiny your fingertips, enhanced reflexes, enhanced strength, enhanced speed. Only slightly, but you were promised massive updates in the time to come. \n\n\nAnd now... here you stood. Two years later. Free of that hell. \n", "Back to the present": "Today\n\n\nThe cold night air slaps you in the face in a wonderful way. You're thankful they kept some of your receptors so you can still feel things now that you're on the outside and able to feel more than just a grim, small room that even without any general awareness of the outside world, you knew was a gloomy place to be. You walk a few steps down the dark and empty street, but take a moment to look around and admire all the beauty in this. A bizarre feeling soaks through you, not knowing where to go or what to do. No sense of purpose now that your original life mission - the one you were created into this world to do - was gone. You find that time is moving a bit quicker than you'd expect, as the few minutes you thought had passed had actually been a lot more than that, and you can now hear the sirens in the distance. Police. You've been imbued with plenty of information on them - you're not a fan. Because of the information in your system, you know better than to stay and try to reason with them, or fight them. Before the sirens can get any closer, you get out of there.\n\n\n----\n\n\nRUN\n\n\n----\n\n\nYou don't bother to take a moment to look around or analyze. You simply run. Your enhanced speed allows you to run at levels that would impress Usain Bolt - and you have no receptors that exhaust you, so you can keep running as long as you'd like. Before you know it, you're several blocks away from the smoke in the sky. You approach the inner part of the city, and your inner clock tells you it's 4:12 AM, and things will begin to open up soon. You don't know where to go, what to do, or how to get anywhere. But a sudden feeling beckons you. It calls for you to walk through a very specific direction. \n\n\n \n", "Follow your feelings": "The feeling inside you drags you down an old street. You continue to press on. You've learned how to navigate the streets through more data that was pumped into your supercomputer brain. Cross on green, when the little walking man logo appears. Wait. Nod at passerby's. Why did that one look at me weird? Look into fixing social interactions in future updates. You continue to walk down an old street until you approach a neighborhood. Relatively quiet, seems to be a nice and peaceful area. Something continues to pull at you and drag you towards a specific location. Upon arrival, you are able to make some recollections. You arrive at an old house - nothing special, but 'warm' nonetheless. You walk up to the door and open it - they never did lock the doors, did they? This was a nice area, after all. You quietly close the door behind you, and continue walking down an old hall. \n\n\nCertain memories begin to protrude through your mind. Running down these halls carelessly, throwing toys around, making a mess. Playing with your mother and father. Bringing friends over in high school. You see wooden frames on the table, pictures of you. You climb the stairs, holding on to the banister as you work your way up. Then you see it in close proximity. That room. You walk up to it slowly and without hesitation you open the door. You don't quite understand why just yet, but something inside you rumbles. A feeling of nausea, sickness, pain? But also love, and warmth. And there they are. You scan the two bodies lying on the bed. Mr. and Mrs. Perez. Your parents. You flick on the light as your body begins to shake, your systems weren't programmed for this. The sudden burst of light forces your parents to leap out of their bed defensively. You eye your father first. Angry, scared... and then, utter confusion. Your mother puts her hands over her mouth and gasps as the tears begin to pour out from her face. She leaps towards you, but is quickly held back by your father.\n\n\n\"MY LITTLE GIRL?!\"\n\n\nShe screams. But your father does his best to hold her back as he takes a defensive position.\n\n\n\"What... who are you?! Lauren? No. But you -\"\n\n\nAlmost overcome with grief and warmth, you don't take a second of hesitation. This is beyond programming, this is beyond your system's functions. You begin to have feelings that you didn't believe you had as it all starts coming back to you.\n\n\n\"Dad. It's me. It's Lauren. I swear. It's me.\"\n\n\nYou utter your first words that weren't programmed into you. The non-mechanical part of your brain begins to throb as the human memories begin to all come back. Your father finally lets go of your mother, as she lunges herself towards you and clamps you in the tightest hug she's given you since that time you were a kid and got lost at the mall. \n\n\n\"Oh my baby. How is this possible? We buried you.\"\n\n\nYou cut her off, but decide not to tell her about what you've become. \n\n\n\"I've been given a second chance, mom. God is real! I went to heaven. I met him. I was good to Him, and He told me I could have a second chance at life. To help the grief that my parents have been put through. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me!\"\n\n\nYour analysis suggests your parents are confused. Your story sounds completely unbelievable, but they're also relieved. They're not thinking about this too much - you're here. Your data pack on world religions comes into play here, and it may prove to be handy. Your mother shouts,\n\n\n\"Wait, so He exists?! This is amazing Lauren. We need to get out there, spread His word! He has given us the greatest gift possible. You, our baby girl!\"\n\n\nYou do your best work to try and keep this exposure to a minimum.\n\n\n\"No mom. I made a deal with Him. I would not try to interfere in worldly affairs regarding Him or His existence. In exchange I could come back. To you.\"\n\n\nYour father sits frozen. For decades he had been an Atheist, but your story may have caused him to shift on that. You feel a sense of remorse, lying to them and possibly changing their entire worldview, but it's worth it. More believable than what actually happened to you, anyway. Plus if this became a big national thing, those men may never stop hunting you down. You need to keep this as low-key as possible. For the first time since you walked in, your father stands up out of his bed. He walks over to you and shares your mother in embracing you. The three of you share a long group hug before he speaks.\n\n\n\"I don't know what to believe. But all I know is that my little girl is here. It's you. I can see you, I can sense you. I believe it's you. My daughter. My sweet, sweet daughter.\"\n\n\nTears begin to form in his eyes, but for some reason you aren't able to share that. You do feel warm, though. After a few more seconds of family bonding, your mother proclaims,\n\n\n\"I bet Jared must be going insane right now! Have you told him? Would you know where to find him, even? We haven't talked to him in a long time, but I believe he still works at his old job!\"\n\n\nJARED! That word instantly triggers a feeling inside you. As those memories begin to pour back into your mind, breaking through whatever was preventing you from accessing these memories earlier. You begin to remember everything. Those times you snuck him into your house, those moments you shared together. Your wedding. You instantly realize you need to go see him. \n\n\n\"I haven't actually talked to Jared yet. I only just now made my journey down from above. I should go see him!\" - you say.\n\n\nYour mother responds, \"Oh yes, he'll be so happy! But first, we need to get you out of that. God has a particular fashion sense, is that what they make you wear up there? Oh well. We'll just have to pack when it's our turn to go up there! For now, go check out your room honey. We left it exactly as it was two years ago. We didn't have the heart to touch it. It's exactly as you left it. Get in there and get a change of clothes. I know it's early but perhaps we can all catch up, you can tell us about your exploits over breakfast, and then you can go visit Jared!\" \n\n\n-----\n\n\nHours pass. You and your parents spend time over the breakfast table. Your mother makes your favorite breakfast - blueberry pancakes. You remember that humans need to eat to survive, something you haven't had to do for years. The warmth of the moist bread touches your lips and blissful memories and feelings course through you. All these flavors, these textures. You may not need to eat to live, but it's quite an amazing feeling. You spend hours scourging through your knowledge of the Bible that was implanted within you for purposes of social interaction. You use this knowledge to make up many stories of your exploits up in heaven. Meeting God, the angels, the beautiful blue water that was just made for you... explaining away any possible inconsistency with your stories. After a few hours, their cheerful and bright faces have brought more than enough joy to you. And you really want to go see Jared. You're all dressed up for the occasion. A nice, long black coat. Your hair is done for the first time in a long time, you wear a black shirt under with some tight jeans that go down to your high-heeled black boots. It's time to go.\n\n\n\"I'm glad we were able to talk now, mom and dad. But I think I should go see Jared now. He probably has a lot of questions too.\"\n\n\nYour mom responds, \n\n\n\"Of course honey! And please tell him we said hi. Oh, also your car is in the garage! We kept it around and have been driving it - hope you don't mind. After the accident, we got some donations to fix it up. I hope it doesn't bring back any bad memories. The keys are by the sink.\"\n\n\nYou smile and nod, before walking over and grabbing them. You begin to march out the door before your father speaks up.\n\n\n\"Oh, and baby. Please. Come back to us this time. We can't lose you again.\"\n\n\nYou turn back towards him and smile.\n\n\n\"Of course dad.\" \n\n\nYou open up the garage from the inside and pull into your car. The feeling of dread begins to sink in for a bit. Bad memories of the last time you were in this death machine. But also good memories. Driving around with Jared. ...Laying down in the backseat with him. All that passion. You pull out and your data on how to drive begins to kick in - not that you really need it! You've always been a fair driver. You drive down your old street as the sun is now out and about. The brightness is almost soothing. You've felt the night sky, but this is your first time feeling the warm sun, and seeing all the beauty around you in the daylight. Bright, green leaves on the trees and the grass. Roses. Black roses - your favorite. The world is so beautiful. You begin to arrive at your destination. Jared's office. He settled down early, got the first good job his dad helped him get. Selling car insurance isn't the greatest gig, but it helped pay the bills... and for your wedding, so you never complained. You arrive at the big building and park in the nearest possible spot. Then you exit.\n\n\n \n", "Jared's office": "You arrive at the office. The front steps feel like they stretch for miles, even though they're quite short. Upon reaching the door, you don't bother to knock. You walk right on in. It's relatively empty, a slow day. Good. More time to catch up. You catch a glimpse of the lady at the front desk. Though you don't recognize her, she seems to recognize you. The shock in her eyes tells you all you need to know. You look towards her and simply say,\n\n\n\"I need to see Jared\"\n\n\nShe nods in her shock, and points you through. As if you needed directions. You begin to march down the hall, but before you can even reach his office - you see him. He seems to be quite busy, holding a stack of papers as he walks to the printer. He looks up for a second and sees you, then looks back down at his work. It takes him a second, but then it hits. And he shoots his gaze right back up. In his shock he drops all his papers - but right now he doesn't care. You keep your eyes locked on him - and he does the same. His bottom lip begins to quiver - it was adorable how it would do that sometimes, whenever he was in great shock. A feeling overcomes you but you can't quite describe it. The horror you were in a few hours ago is starting to sink away, like it never happened. And all you can imagine is the life you were going to have with him. \n\n\n\"L-L-Lauren...?\"\n\n\nYour body is warm and trembling softly. And your analysis tells you that he feels the exact same way. You begin to march forward towards him, and then he runs towards you. You begin to remember every minute detail of your relationship with him. All the highs and lows, the arguments, the kisses. The love you two shared. And then you finally catch up and embrace in a hug. You can tell he's crying because your jacket's shoulder begins to feel moist. You hold on to him and grab the back of his head before patting him. \n\n\n\"There there. It's me, my love.\"\n\n\nHe begins to shake as he mumbles out,\n\n\n\"But how...?\"\n\n\nYou smile and pause for a second. You never kept any major secrets from him. This would be no different.\n\n\n\"I can tell you, but we can't do it here. My love. Let's go out somewhere so we can talk.\"\n\n\nJared doesn't fail to oblige, and he ignores the big mess of papers he just left all over the ground. \n\n\n\"Yes. Let's go, I... I'm a bit at a loss for words here.\"\n\n\n\"Shhh. It'll all become clearer soon ok?\" - you respond. \n\n\nHe pulls his keys out from his pocket and offers to drive you two there, and you agree. The ride is quiet, as you can tell he's in deep thought and concentration, then you arrive at your destination.\n\n\n---\n\n\nHis beautiful green eyes light up as his favorite cocktail shrimp is brought to the table. You opted for a chicken sandwich. Soul food, food that you've missed in the years you've been gone. Before you know it, you two are catching up.\n\n\n\"So tell me, what happened to you Lauren? It's really you, I can tell. I know you more than anyone. But how? How are you here? How is this possible?\"\n\n\nYou realize that you need to tell him the truth.\n\n\n\"I don't remember much, Jared. My story is that  That's the story I'm going with. But the truth is, I have no idea. I remember the accident, crashing, blacking out. Then I don't remember much else from there. It's all still a blur to me. But I was taken in by a group of people. They brought me back to life, Jared. They replaced some of my body with weapons, a computer. I know it's hard to understand, even I don't seem to fully get it. I just know that I'm here now. And all the memories are coming back to me.\"\n\n\nJared looks at you with a sense of disbelief, but he knows you're being truthful. He's always known when you're lying and when you're not. \n\n\n\"So you're telling me, you were taken by some men after you basically died... and they brought you back... as an android?\"\n\n\nYou look back at him,\n\n\n\"Something like that. I believe they wanted to make me into a super-soldier to help fight in their wars. But look, Jared. It doesn't matter now. None of it matters. I'm still me. I'm here. We're here! These past two years have been hell but in less than a day I'm starting to remember everything. And I love you, Jared. And now we can continue where we left off! We can continue our life. We can... try again.\"\n\n\nJared's eyes widen. His face looks a bit distraught. Your analysis suggests he's feeling a bit of agony for what he's about to say. \n\n\n\"Lauren... oh. No. I'm so sorry. But... well, Lauren. I thought you were dead. I had to move on. I thought it's what you'd want me to do. So I did. Lauren, I've found someone else. I have a family now. I have a baby now, with my fiance. He's one year old, and the light of my life. I'm so sorry Lauren.\"\n\n\nFor the first time in a long time, you begin to feel something you hadn't quite remembered. Sorrow? Sadness? Pain? You don't know how to put it into words, your system can't really explain this either. You just know you don't like it.\n\n\n\"But... Jared. I love you.\"\n\n\nHe looks back at you now,\n\n\n\"I love you too Lauren. I never forgot about you, I never replaced you - I swear. I just had to move on. I couldn't let the pain consume me. I found someone else. And I love her. But Lauren, I still love you too. I want to be here for you. As your friend.\"\n\n\nThe heart they left inside you that has been wholly meaningless for a while now begins to feel a bit of pain at these words. He continues.\n\n\n\"Look, let me prove it to you. These men, these men who took you. We need to find them, we'll take them down - together. They did this to you. They brought you back a while ago, they could have let you out sooner. They could be helping a lot of people with this technology, but they're using it to... do what? Make super soldiers? We need to get them back for this. I can help you. I have connections, I'm competent. I own a gun. Let's find them and we can end them, together. If you're really a super soldier, your abilities should be insane. Together, we can take them out. What do you say?\"\n\n\n \n", "\"Yes. I agree. Let's do it.\"": "\u201cWe need to get them back for this.\u201d\n\n\nYou look back into his eyes as he sits across you.\n\n\n\u201cYes. I agree. That would be nice. We can work together as a team one more time then.\u201d\n\n\nJared nods. His eyes light up once again. Your analysis suggests he feels very bad about the situation that you are both in. But he also feels anger upon hearing what happened to you at the hands of those people.\n\n\n\u201cWhat should we even do? Do you know anything about them?\u201d\n\n\nYou shake your head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t. They provided me with a way to analyze my surroundings but they knew a way to counter it for themselves, so that I could never use it on them outside of basic functions. I don\u2019t know who they are, I don\u2019t know most of their names, and I burned down the warehouse they were keeping me at not too far from here.\u201d\n\n\nJared looks disappointed. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the answer he was hoping for.\n\n\n\u201cWell, do you remember ANYTHING about them at all?\" You think for a second before remembering the Sergeant.\n\n\n\u201cI remember one of them being highly feared. The Sergeant. He was always wearing a military outfit with a lot of badges and patches, suggesting he was a massive higher up. I remember him mention something about being in the Air Force.\u201d\n\n\nJared\u2019s eyes light up once again.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, Lauren! There\u2019s only one base here that is for the Air Force and I have plenty of connections there. One of them can get us on base, we can sneak away from him and find the Sergeant and get some answers\u2026 and maybe some revenge.\u201d\n\n\nYou think for a second.\n\n\n\u201cYou want to infiltrate a military base to try and help me take out a high profile member of the military? That seems highly improbable, and appears to be a suicide mission Jared. Why would you do this? You said it yourself, you have a child and a family now.\u201d\n\n\nThe words coming out of your mouth sting, but you know it\u2019s true.\n\n\n\u201cYou need to be there for them, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\nHe shoots back at you,\n\n\n\u201cNo. Listen. No one in a million years could have figured that we would find ourselves in this situation. Who would have ever expected that you would come back to me? And now it\u2019s too late, as I\u2019ve moved on with my life. But I still love you, and I owe you part of my life. So I will do this for you, to prove to you that I still love and care for you, and to prove that though I\u2019ve moved on, you still mean the world to me.\u201d\n\n\nYou realize it would be futile to try and argue with him on this.\n\n\n\u201cOkay then. Get in touch with your connection, and get us on base. I\u2019ll meet up with you tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\n\nThe next day, you and Jared meet up and Jared seems dressed for battle. He wears cargo pants and shoes, and a puffy jacket that you can only assume hides some sort of bullet proof vest under it.\n\n\n\u201cWatch out for the gun, it\u2019s in my glove compartment. I told my connect we were gonna go visit him, he\u2019s gonna get us on base and then we can sneak off.\u201d\n\n\nYou nod. Upon approaching Los Angeles Air Force Base, you two drive up to him in the parking lot outside. Jared gets out and shakes hands with him as they smile and catch up. He walks over to your window and shakes your hand.\n\n\n\u201cHi, nice to meet you! I\u2019m Taylor, Jared\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\n\nYou smile back at him.\n\n\n\u201cIt is a pleasure, fellow human. My name is Lauren.\u201d\n\n\nJared face palms behind you, as he then instructs Jared to get into the drivers seat and pull you guys into base so he can show you two his cool new apartment. Now with no roommate! As you drive onto base and he starts taking you to his humble abode, Jared asks,\n\n\n\u201cHey, so where do the higher ups around here hang out?\u201d\n\n\nPuzzled, Taylor responds\n\n\n\u201cWell, they have their own living spaces if that\u2019s what you mean. They\u2019re way nicer than ours, we get the scraps over on this side, they get the nice apartments on base, sometimes even their own houses!\u201d\n\n\nJared nods.\n\n\n\u201cThough most of them are on duty right now, it\u2019s a busy day today. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m off at the moment!\u201d\n\n\nYou continue driving and finally arrive at his apartment. You both exit the car behind him and walk into his home. He excitedly tries to get you two to have a seat. Then he offers you something to drink. Jared accepts, and then when Taylor turns around to march over to the kitchen, Jared gives you a sign. You scan Taylor\u2019s body and then hit him square on the back of the head, providing just enough pressure to put him to sleep without causing any permanent damage.\n\n\n\u201cThat was painful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s a big boy.\u201d\n\n\nYou and Jared turn back out towards the door, Jared grabs the keys from Taylor\u2019s pocket and you two begin to march right out. Something inside you tells you that you need to prevent Jared from leaving this house with you. But he also decided to come on his own free will. You could put him to sleep too, and leave him here safely. Or you could bring him with you.\n", "Take him out": "While his back is turned, you give him a rapid jab of only slightly more power than the one you gave Taylor. He doesn't have time to express his response at this betrayal before he falls forward and collapses. You quickly take the keys out of his pocket and run to his car, before jumping into the drivers' seat and turning that engine on. You quickly find yourself speeding around the air force base. Using the knowledge implanted inside of you of the various bases and their schematics, you are able to locate the area of the base where all the, so-called, \"nice\" houses are. From what you know about the Sergeant, you realize the most likely situation is that he decided to give himself the nicest house here. His own ego and his personality all add up, lighting off your algorithm as you're able to find an area you believe he should live in with relative ease.  \n\n\n\"The houses on this block seem to be fitting of the type of profile my system has created of the Sergeant.\"\n\n\nYou think to yourself. Only a few minutes pass, and you're proven correct. A car pulls up to the third-most house from where you sit, and a man comes out. It's him. He looks to be very miserable. Your analysis suggests he's had a very rough past 24 hours - but you really didn't need to scan him to see that much. He gets out of his car and begins to walk down his driveway, so you realize that now is the perfect time to cut him off. You run out of your car, open up Jared's glove compartment, and pull out his gun - which is already loaded - and you run out of the car immediately. \n\n\n\"Stop. Stop walking.\"\n\n\nThe Sergeant turns towards you. \n\n\n\"Oh my god. It's you. You monster! You killed those -\"\n\n\n\"SHUT UP!\"\n\n\nYour systems begin to heat up a bit, as his gaze becomes one of horror. \n\n\n\"You thought you could mess with my existence? Lock me up and create a monster? Well now that monster is back to get you. Dr. Frankenstein, this will be your demise. Doomed by your own hand.\"\n\n\nYou raise the gun up.\n\n\n\"Wait! No, Diana, please!\"\n\n\n\"IT'S LAUREN, YOU BASTARD. Diana is the name YOU tried to give me. Now die!\"\n\n\nYou blast him in the head with perfect aim. His corpse hits the floor immediately, and blood begins to pour out of him as you stand over his mangled body. You keep your eyes locked on him. Then you pull the gun up and begin to fire more bullets into his already-dead corpse, out of pure rage. Your systems suggest this is pointless, but before they can try to ease your mind, they begin to malfunction. A loud BANG is heard from behind you, and before you can turn around - it's too late. A young man, about 22 years old, has stepped out of the front door of the house, gun in hand. He blasts through your skull from behind with it, then blasts you again. Your systems begin to screech internally.\n\n\nCRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE. SHUTTING DOWN.\n\n\nThe last words you hear before your system turns to black, is the sound of the young man screaming,\n\n\n\"DAD! DAD NO!!\"\n", "Bring him with you": "You decide to bring him along. This was his choice, afterall. \n\n\n\"Ok, let's get in your car and go. My systems have created an algorithm of this man's behavior. Going off that, it should be very easy to find him. Let's go.\"\n\n\nJared looks impressed, he gets into his car and you get into the passengers' side. He speeds off as you guide him around the base. A few passerby soldiers give you weird looks, since they don't recognize you, but they're also too busy being miserable and working horrible shifts to give too much of a crap. After a bit of manually guiding him, you approach a nice neighborhood on base.\n\n\n\"Are you sure this is it?\"\n\n\nYou nod.\n\n\n\"Yes, my algorithms are almost positive this is it.\"\n\n\nAfter a few short moments, you're proven right. As a car pulls up, and the heat signature from inside it makes your scanner ring. This is him. \n\n\n\"He's in that car. We should cut him off before he gets out and goes inside.\"\n\n\nBoth of you exit the car, Jared reaches over to his glove compartment and pulls out his already-loaded gun. You run over to him as Jared pulls his gun up and screams,\n\n\n\"STOP, ASSHOLE.\"\n\n\nThe Sergeant turns towards the two of you. His eyes drift down as he screams,\n\n\n\"DIANA! It's you! You.. you monster! You killed those people -\"\n\n\n\"Diana? Who the hell is Diana?!\"\n\n\nJared cuts him off. You look over to him and respond.\n\n\n\"Diana is the name this piece of crap gave me. My name is not Diana. It's Lauren. I'm not one of your soldiers, Sergeant.\"\n\n\nHe looks back over to you, then eyes Jared with his gun, \n\n\n\"I see. Out of the three test subjects we had, you were my greatest disappointment, Diana. You had so much potential. You were going to help us save the world. Think of all the lives you could have saved with your abilities, helping out our boys on the field. But you selfishly decided to go after your own wants and needs instead. I hope you're happy\"-BANG\n\n\nJared has heard enough. He sends a bullet through the man's skull, dropping him instantly.\n\n\n\"That's enough out of you. Don't listen to a word he said, Lauren. He's a monster, who tried to take advantage of you. Don't fall for it.\"\n\n\nYou smile back at him and nod, then you grab his arms. The two of you lock eyes and begin to build a mental connection. It is quickly severed however, by yet another BANG. You look up and see a hole in Jared's head. Blood begins to pour out as he groans,\n\n\n\"ohh... no.\"\n\n\nand he hits the floor. You look to the side and see a young man, looks to be about 22 years old, crying his eyes out as he sees his dad on the ground. He drops down to his knees and sobs,\n\n\n\"DAD!!!\" \n\n\nYour systems begin to fluctuate. Your anger rises as you look down at Jared's corpse. Your beautiful man, now mangled and deformed. You shriek. A shriek loud enough that it almost causes a small earthquake. The young man looks up at you, and before he can react, the woman with bloodshot eyes leaps at him and begins to mangle him limb from limb. You tear at his throat, ending him rather quickly. Then begin to tear off fingers, limbs, whatever you can think of. Neighbors begin to hear as you listen to the sounds of people loading up guns and rushing outside. Your extend your hands forward and with all of your anger, let out a sonic wave from your fingers so powerful that it causes the floor in front of you to explode beneath everyone. It leaves a crater that is several miles forward, almost wiping out this entire neighborhood and leaving a giant gap in the big wall around the base. You run. \n\n\n---\n\n\nYou run as fast as you can, escaping the base. Then keep running for miles, ignoring all the commotion behind you. You sprint out into the wilderness nearby and keep running. \n\n\n\"I should have never came back. Jared's dead because of me. This is all my fault. I'm a monster. I'm a freak. Why did I agree to this? I can't be a part of this society anymore. I need to get out of here.\"\n\n\nYou run into the wilderness and don't look back. \n"}, "tree": {"A bright light, an old bed, and a creepy warehouse.": {"Continue": {"Back to the present": {"Follow your feelings": {"Jared's office": {"\"Yes.

You run your hand over the smooth surface of your pool, sending ripples out for eternity, coating the expanse in an endless pattern of swirling waves and crystalline umbra swaying to and fro.\n\nYou shift your feet. They sink a little, but still manage to keep you afloat, supported on nothing but a strange springiness. You look downwards, expecting your reflection to gaze back, but you are met with a grotesque beast of three horns and a single sapphire eye. The maw of the monster glows, and seems to leap into your face amidst the undulating waves, eerily lifelike.\n\nInstinctively, you stumble back. Your feet slip in the slick liquid, and you fall, plunging below the surface. You gasp, eyes fluttering in the piercing cold, the world swimming before your eyes\u2026\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\nYou sit up from your chamber, sputtering and wheezing for breath. With great effort, you focus your wavering vision on the figure before you.\n\nThe young man puts a hand on your shoulder as he comes into focus.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he says, beaming an identification badge onto your chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve arrived at Pluto-23 safely, I\u2019m Denis, just responsible for escorting you to the governor.\u201d\n\nDenis takes a sweeping glance over your compartment, \u201cJust to make sure, you arrived from the Togens, right?\u201d\n\nYou nod, and wave away his hand looking to lift you out of the capsule. Lying down again, your fingers find the ejection button with little effort, and the capsule lifts you out while fitting you with a loose full body suit. Denis glances towards your capsule again, obvious admiration in his eyes, before gesturing for you to follow.\n\nAlong the way, Denis briefed you on the state of Humanity. Through your efforts in transferring technology from thousands of light years away, human progress has taken leaps and bounds to the point where the entire Solar System was under their control. One by one, he introduced you to the colonies on each of the planets and their respective moons. You couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction, knowing that your work had helped to bring about such a significant change.\n\nHe pauses after discussing the elaborate underground system inside of Mercury.\n\n\u201cBut I assume you know why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nWordlessly, he switches the display. The sun frailly glowed with an eerie purple hue, its once brilliant corona now distorted and twisted by an alien disease. Strange tubes, pulsing orange with powerful pumps and compressions, snakes across its surface like a vine smothering the life of a once mighty tree.\n\n\u201cThe governor should speak about it more with you,\u201d he grimaces as the two of you round a bend and arrive at a discrete set of steel doors. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting in there.\u201d\n\nDenis walks off as the doors hiss open, leaving you alone in the echoey steel halls.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe governor, a plump and stout figure with eyes hidden by the creases on his face as he smiles, invites you to a seat on his bed beside his work table.\n\nThe room is dimly lit, but it seems more like a bedroom than a working office, evident by the bed you\u2019re sitting on and the few books situated on a marble shelf nearby.\n\nHe clears his throat, and you nod in response.\n\n\u201cThey told us that we have five days,\u201d he said sternly, cutting straight to the point.\n\nYou look over at the planetary themed calendar (marked with earth days) hanging on the wall, a large red dot over the 9th.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cwe have three.\u201d\n", "Governor\u2019s problems": "Upon hearing the news, he nods and dials a few digits into a panel on his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019ll lie to us one last time,\u201d he said, growling into the ground.\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d You probe.\n\n\u201cThe merchants,\u201d he replies gruffly. \u201cLook, when we lost contact with you and the Togens for a few years because of the ray tides, they just appeared in our backyards. Called us into a large meeting and told us that in exchange for doing some small experiments on our sun, they\u2019ll let us in on some of their \u201ccore\u201d technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody believed their shit, of course, but they must have done something behind closed doors because when it came to voting, over 50 of our 70 strong committee voted for their right to our sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cBah, what technology? They flooded us with some simulation machines, some slightly better engines, and lots of\u2026 servant robots. In return, what have we given away?\u201d\n\nHe breathes in deeply, looking at the deathly image of the sun projected on the wall.\n\nYou let the silence carry on momentarily, before cautiously remarking, \u201cIs there anything we could do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but that\u2019s where I was hoping you could help,\u201d he replies, leaning in intently. \u201cDo you have any way to establish communication with the Togens again? I\u2019m sure that they have some way of helping us out, doesn\u2019t their influence span multiple galaxies?\u201d\n\nDuring your period of stay with the Togens, you weren\u2019t aware of much scientific progress that they\u2019ve actively made. They seemed to be favored children of the universe, born with stunning intellect and understanding of the laws of the universe. What human scientists toil for decades to get, they seem to \u201cknow\u201d at a glance. While no star wrangling technology was available for you to see, it seemed certain that they could contain the explosion of a diseased star.\n\n\u201cThey should, \u201d you say, nodding. \u201cHowever, contacting them is a little trickier. I was told before I left that we needed to send a high power EM pulse towards their interception node stationed in the asteroid belt, and they\u2019ll\u2026 somehow establish a connection. They haven\u2019t told me how.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo reason to dwell on how they can establish it, there\u2019s only one place here that\u2019s able to send out something like that,\u201d the governor says, standing up decisively and pulling a case from underneath the bed. \u201cAnd you better gear up for the trip there.\u201d\n\nWhile you fit yourself with a stiff vest and a small handgun, the governor issues a few barks into a communication line to assemble a haggard group of militiamen. You are surprised to see the dark, sunken eyes of these men that betrays their intense fighting for an extended period of time.\n\nThe governor, as if sensing your confusion, sighs grimly. \u201cEver since the SSA announced the imminent demise of our star, riots- no, rebellions have broken out in nearly all the stations. We\u2019re no special case. Our little cluster of tunnels and rooms are painted red with fighting.\u201d\n\nNot willing to continue further, he escorts you to the center of their formation. The huddled mass cautiously moves out, filling the steel corridors with the sound of boots striking steel and the clattering of weapons.\n\nVery soon, the group encounters some resistance. It was, at first, a few scattered rebels that were dispatched easily. However, the sounds of fighting drew more and more enemies until your little regiment was engaged in a standstill with another similarly sized group of rebels.\n\nTime wasn\u2019t on your side, and the governor knows that too as he paces around furiously behind some cover. At one point, he even suggested negotiating a peace with this group of enemies temporarily, just to get by.\n", "Peace Talks": "A white flag was thrown out, and the governor himself went ahead and negotiated with the rebels. Surprisingly, he emerged unscathed and access through their \u201cterritory\u201d was granted. Perhaps it was the promise of saving the sun, because a few of the men that were aiming their guns at you previously now gave you a stiff nod as you passed by.\n\nAs you approach the interstationary communications center, you feel your hairs stand on end. The giant contraption looked like an obelisk of sorts, with antennae and transmitters embedded haphazardly along its length. Wasting no time, you and the technician of the group hurried up to the control platform and began turning the emitter in the direction specified by the Togens.\n\nWithout any problems, the emitter powers up and begins firing frequent pulses of powerful waves, drowning the room with a dull hum.\n\n\u201cWhen will they connect?\u201d You see the governor mouth silently, and you look back at the dashboard. No response.\n\nYou turn to shrug, but a massive tremor through the station sends you teetering to the edge of the control platform. The technician beside you flies directly towards the stabilizing beams of the emitter, which groan in protest as the large device tilts with the jolt. Coughing from the smoke pouring from the base of the emitter, you hurry to right it while soldiers scramble around in the vicinity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re back,\u201d the governor wheezes, having just climbed up to the platform. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve grown tenfold in number. I think they\u2019re trying to break open the entire center-\u201d\n\nAnother jolt sends him onto his feet, and he shakily rises with his hand on the guardrail. \u201cListen. I can go and reason with them, but the machine might blow at any time.\u201d\n", "Push Through": "Time is of essence, you thought, and peace talks may not even go through. You and the governor gave each other a grim look, and leapt into the fray of a desperate scramble through the rebel holdings.\n\nInitially surprised by the sudden aggression, the insurgents gave up a few rooms while they regathered and began a series of punishing pushbacks.\n\nAs you sit, back to a supply crate with a few others, you notice a faint blue glow coming from a room almost shrouded by smoke. You could make out a plaque beside the door that spelled \u201cinterstationary communications\u201d.\n\nIt is tempting, definitely, but the sprint across the hall is long and the walls are riddled with bullet holes.\n", "Check out the room": "You grit your teeth and leap out into the open, making a run for the room. A few men follow, but most stay back guardedly. A few bullets whiz your way, one just a hand\u2019s width from your shoulder. You wince as you hear a man cry out in pain, but with one last push you half roll, half fall into the room.\n\nIt was a short distance teleporter, built into the wall. A sterile, cold device, the surface was devoid of any markings or interfaces save for a few scratches.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t waste any time,\u201c you say to the men that made it with you. \u201cThe quicker I can establish a connection the more time we have to save the sun.\u201d The teleporter seems open, so without hesitation you take a stride through the dimly blue vortex\u2026\n\n\u2026and you find yourself inside of a closet of sorts. A few boxes strung with wires are scattered around the floor and a few K-100 models stand motionless against a wall, but this certainly wasn\u2019t the communications station that the governor had described. Alarmed, you backpedal to return to the teleporter, but instead find yourself inside of a deactivated transport chamber. You open your mouth to cry for help, but the boxes before you are faster. Without warning, they rapidly expand, crushing you against the chamber walls.\n\nStruggling against the suffocating cushion, you desperately pull your pistol out and fire a few rounds into the box. You feel the gases inside heat up and expand in reaction, and you pray that the traps might deactivate.\n\nUnfortunately, unable to contain the excited gases, the device pops, consuming you in a fiery explosion.\n", "Stay back": "You decide that the room was too dangerous to go for, and stay back behind the wall. The rattle of a few bullets washes over your spot, showering you with sparks from their collisions with metal. A few pieces of shrapnel clatter a few feet away, one scratching a gash in a man\u2019s side.\n\nYou could hear the hoots and the hollers grow in intensity as more and more rebels seem to show up, drawn in by the noise of battle. From an equal standstill, the tables have turned against you. The insurgents are now forming groups to prod at the governor\u2019s soldiers, and you were sure that it was only a matter of time before they realized their advantage.\n\nYou shake your head at the governor who was ducked under a similarly battered barrier, and he reluctantly calls for a retreat.\n\n\u2014\n\nDefeated and worn, you sit in silence at a remote sector of the station. The rebels now had full control of the interstationary emitter, and god knows what they plan to send with it. Just a few hours prior, your stopwatch clocked in a whole dozen hours of action. Time was slipping away, fast, and you weren\u2019t even aware of the possibility that the Togens would want to help you.\n\nNevertheless, each planetary colony should be equipped with a device of a similar magnitude. It was calculated that within an hour or so, your travelling compartment from the Togens should be able to directly line up with Saturn\u2019s station A, giving you another chance at establishing communication.\n\nYou said little as the pod was safely escorted out of station, instead tuning in to the patriotic broadcasts ringing out from the communications center behind you. \u201cTwo days\u201d, you think, eyes trained on the purplish speck in the starry sky.\n", "Saturn - A": "Saturn, one of the first to be commercially settled on, was prized for its beauty and ease of access for water. Saturn A, in turn, became one of the most populous colonies out of all the planets.\n\nSo populous that the silence and darkness of the complex startles you as you approach. The station remained docked to a mountain-sized iceberg, slumbering without a single flash of light or communication signal.\n\nYou land on the dock, according to directions from the governor. What should\u2019ve been a bustling spaceport of people from all walks of life is now completely devoid of any humans. The port doors slide open with a ding, and a recorded voice springs up from a speaker installed beside the entrance.\n\nThe steel halls echo as it blares: \u201cWelcome to Saturn - A, a beautiful and bustling station with-\u201d\n\nYou shut it off, leaving just an echo rattling through the empty station. A few moments pass, but nothing else stirs, and you make your way into the depths. The station seems to be abandoned, with objects hastily packed up and strewn all over the floor. You see a few stores and rooms welded shut, but yielded little after you pried a few of the rusted doors open with ease.\n\nJust when you thought the station was entirely abandoned, the clattering of something falling to the floor draws you over to a room. Inside, you see the first humans on the station so far, a pair of children rummaging through what looks like a storage room. You see them jump at the sound of your footsteps, and run away through the maze of overturned crates while screeching and shouting in terror and concealed glee. Curious to find others, you follow them (albeit more slowly) through the winding halls. At first, you could generally track them based on the sound of the pitter pattering of their feet, but soon their familiarity of the place loses you.\n\nYou find yourself in a darker, less welcoming sector of the station. You essentially equate it with the slums of your age - low quality buildings and inhabitants compared to the looted areas you were in previously. At least these had marks of inhabitants, with words freshly scratched in places and human voices rising up in the distance.\n\n\u2014\n\nAs you make your way through the tunnel, following the steady chanting reverberating through the entire subsystem, you gradually come upon a townsquare of sorts, situated in the slums of Saturn - A. You see a crowd of people in dark garbs, head down solemnly. They surround a ring of 7 robed cultists dancing slowly and methodically around a glowing orb situated atop an obsidian pillar.\n\nThe cultists appear to be a dark parody of humanity, with their features distorted by mutilation and twisted practices. As they dance, sometimes furious and other times languid, a sense of horror sets upon you. You see, under their robes, their sunken eyes filled with a sickly pulp clouding their vision, their pallid gray skin reflecting unnatural hues from the orb. From afar you could smell the scent of decay and rot from them, as if they were long dead and reanimated.\n\nAt length, you look away from the ghastly inner circle and refocus your eyes on the men and women outside. They, to your relief, seemed to still retain much of the human countenance, just earnestly praying toward the orb, their eyes closed. You turn to leave, not willing to look any further, and find yourself face to face with 2 small figures. The children from before are now just a few steps before you, and now you could see them clearly. They seem like normal children, but with a strange weakness to them. You could see their wan faces heaving up and down with every breath, gasping for air.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t your main concern, though, and you wave frantically toward them for silence. While initially stunned, the two suddenly grin and drop to the floor laughing. As their weak voices drift out through the stagnant air, the chanting stops immediately. You hear the surprised whispers of the crowd as they swarm toward your place of hiding. The children, meanwhile, have darted off.\n\nYou eye the flimsy window leading out to a short drop into an alleyway, and consider your options.\n", "Attempt to \"join\" them temporarily": "The beings were terrifying, but you knew if you wanted to access the emitter in the base, you had to tread on their territory.\n\nWith this thought and a few calming breaths, you sit down near the window you were watching from and wait for their inevitable arrival. Moments later, a few figures stumble up the stairs and take a cautious stance. Shakily, you say, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\nThey look at you strangely, and your legs tense, ready to make a mad dash for the window at any sign of hostility. However, after a few moments, one manages to find his words, and rasp back a broken \u201chello\u201d. Meanwhile, a monster of the inner circle clambers up the stairs vigorously, and hisses at you. Hoping to gain their trust, you hold up your hands in a sign of surrender.\n\nThe woman-like cultist paces around you, jabbing at your arms and legs. Her stench is nearly overpowering at this distance and you struggle to breathe without disgust. After a minute or so of inspection, she seems satisfied and barks a few words in a foreign language to the followers. You see them swarm over and carry you up with their clammy hands, and you feign acceptance.\n\nWhile initially suspicious, you find that the community dwelling around this orb to be close knit and welcoming. You don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re babbling about, but neither do they seem to retain much of their knowledge of english. You could communicate, just very primitively.\n\nFor around half a day or so, you joined their ranks. A few men were willing to walk you through a few of the rituals that they perform around the orb (most of them confounded you to no end), and by chatting with the more talkative members, you were able to piece together a bit of their story.\n\nThey regard the orb as a god sent artifact. While initially disregarded, as time went on the people changed and felt more and more attraction to the orb. Feelings of despair as the rich escaped from their spaceships and left the poor behind gathered the people together to the promise that the orb is their savior. They grew to revere those who spent the most time around the orb - the inner circle - and gradually formed a religion of sorts around it.\n\n\u2014\n\nYou watch as the sun sets on Saturn, one last time. The pale light fades from the horizon, plunging the station into darkness. With just a few hours remaining, it's now or never to contact the Togens. You eye the shadow of the emitter looming in the distance silently, and walk toward it.\n\nThe flicker of the orb draws your eye as you pass it, though. Something inside you tells you that it could, too, save your life.\n", "Pray to the orb": "You cease walking. The alien device seems to swirl before your eyes, the eddies and currents of the strange purple mist almost hypnotizing. Gently, respectfully, you prostrate yourself before the altar, your mouth mimicking some of the words the cultists chant. The orb seems to glow in response, and you throw yourself to the ground instinctively. \u201cSave us all!\u201d you mutter, the words almost foreign to yourself.\n\nIt makes no response, but you feel a soothing wave wash over you, confirming your wishes. With that, you sit faithfully before the altar, waiting.\n\n\u2014\n\nYou feel weak and unsteady as you stand to join the others in a last ritual. All, save for the inner circle, lock their hands together into a great chain around the orb. With a slow, deliberate chant, the group proceeds solemnly around the altar once. The members of the inner circle then make an elaborate gesture, facing away from the orb, and the chanting resumes at a faster pace, and faster, and faster\u2026\n\nSoon, you find yourself embroiled in their frenzy, hooting and hollering along while sprinting dizzying circles around the orb. The townsquare pulsates with a strange, powerful energy that courses through your veins. As the chant grows feverish and all cease their movements to pray, the orb rises from the altar with a vibrant glow.\n\nThe ground shudders and sends you all off of your feet, the first signs of the explosion, but none of you paid it any heed. Instead, everyone gathers around the altar on all fours, in a tangle of grayish limbs and flesh. A crack - as if lightning pierced through the station - jars the entire city, but you cling on. As if hallucinating, you see the trident-like horns of a beast emerging from the orb, bringing with it a blinding gleam. Gradually, the light strengthens, and grows, and grows, filling your entire vision\u2026\n\n\u2014\n\nYou wake, head ringing with a splitting ache. The brightly lit room resembles a doctor\u2019s office from your childhood - strange diagrams and figures scattered throughout, on counters and walls and even beside a primitive sink. Yet, the familiarity only strengthens an unsettling eeriness as you gaze closer at the nonsensical charts and foreign creatures.\n\nYou shut your eyes and attempt to sit up. Nothing. It is almost as if your head was locked in place and your limbs strapped down, fully paralyzing you. It is at that moment that you hear footsteps from far away, outside of your \u201cdoctor\u2019s office\u201d. It rang so vividly and clearly, only muffled by the ruffling of clothes that gradually approached the door. You see the knob turn in slow motion, and the door creeping open to reveal\u2026\n\nJust a regular, dark skinned man dressed in a white coat. \u201cJust like a doctor,\u201d you think, shivering internally. He walks toward you with a faint smile, but as he approaches you can make out three distinct bumps sprouting from the top of his head, betraying the fact that he wasn\u2019t human. You want to struggle, but no matter how hard you try, your body just ignores you.\n\nTaking a seat beside you, the \u201cdoctor\u201d glances over your body with his piercing blue eyes, nodding stiffly. \u201cNot enough time, but I\u2019ll make do,\u201d he purrs with a silky, strange accent.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here,\u201d he continues, suddenly wielding a hook-like scalpel that materialized in his hand. \u201cYour human body is a fascinating machine, so delicate, and yet, so resilient to our engineering. You will thank me for what I am about to bestow upon you.\u201d\n\nAs he speaks, the scalpel lowers past your eye line and sinks into your flesh painlessly. You distinctly feel the blade cut through your flesh, slicing past bones and other organs to reveal your heart, where the hook then grasps, and tears it out of your chest. Helpless, you watch as he lifts the grayish heart, dripping with clear liquid, up into your view with a crooked grin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you something better,\u201d he coos, flicking your old organ across the room and grabbing a strange device from out of the air. With a single motion, he fits the glowing, warm device into the cavity where your heart used to reside and smooths the cut over. As the warm feeling of the device radiates throughout your body, you suddenly regain control of your body. With surprising strength, you push yourself off of the bed and lunge at the \u201cman\u201d, who disappears and reappears a few meters away.\n\n\u201cWhoa there, not so fast,\u201d he says, snapping his fingers. Strange tendrils, dark and thin in shape, restrains you to the wall, while the doctor continues to perform tests on you, sending an arsenal of weapons towards your body and marking the results down. Where a regular human body would be pulverized, yours were only battered and bent in shape, growing back in a matter of seconds. You survived every test painlessly, even dangling out in space without protection.\n\n\u201cTruly a product of your sun, now,\u201d he jokes, tapping on your chest. \u201cOh, one last thing.\u201d He pulls out a syringe from the air, and laughs: \u201cnot a bad imitation, eh?\u201d He then rather ruthlessly stabs it into your temple, and your mind goes blank.\n\n\u2014\n\nYou step emotionlessly out of the shipwreck, its shattered deck slick with blood, and onto a vessel of your own. \u201cNext batch of escapees,\u201d you mutter, steering the ship past the smoldering remains of a planet, into the distance.\n", "ignore it": "You steel your nerves and forcibly tear your gaze from the altar. With shaky steps, you trudge past the townsquare toward the piercing shadow of the communications emitter, its dark figure growing in size as you approach.\n\n\u2014\n\nSaturn A is an old station, built many years before the others. Their emitter, too, is of an older model. Due to technological constraints at the time of its construction, engineers had to massively increase the size of the machine.\n\nThe one before you had fallen into disrepair, with a thin layer of dust coating the various dashboards and contraptions, a rare sight in a mostly metallic station. The main pillar stretches into the sky with approximately double the length of the one on Pluto, ending in a sharp point that pierced through a corpse from years ago that had largely decomposed.\n\nYou breathe heavily as you ascend the control platform, feeling rather weak and nauseous. Strangely, that break before you embarked here seems to have made you more tired than if you had not.\n\nWhile old, most of the controls operate on the same principles as the ones on Pluto. However, as you furiously adjust the direction of the emitter, you suddenly see a flash of gray flesh through your peripheral vision. Alarmed, you whip around, and see nothing but the reflective surface of the large obelisk.\n\nIt takes a few moments for you to realize. Through the partially mottled surface of the emitter, you see your face, sagging and sunken, discolored with a stony gray. You raise your arm close to your face, past the fog that clouded the corner of your vision, verifying your fears. Your heart sinks. You are, after only half a day, no different from the other cultists.\n\nWhile terrified, you waste no time in returning to the controls. A flash of gray shifting here and there in your peripherals, your arms wildly flying from panel to panel, the heavy, labored breathing from behind you\u2026\n\nOne moment you had just finished adjusting the direction of the emitter, and the next you found yourself on the floor, face to \u201cface\u201d with one of the inner circle members. Her foul excuse for a mouth opens, and speaks with an odd combination of a snarl and a gargle. You pause in your fear, however, since you understood her. \u201cI knew you would be in here,\u201d the beast continues. \u201cFrom the moment I set my eyes upon you, I knew your intent was not with our lords.\u201d With a hiss, she mercilessly digs her claws into your shoulders, furiously pushing and cutting large gashes across your body. You cry in pain, and heave her partially off of the floor. Her tiny frame seems deceptively strong, though. With a shake, she sends you back onto the ground, winded and bleeding.\n\nYou spot your watch from the corner of your eye, splattered with dark, diseased blood. 2 minutes before it reaches Saturn.\n\nWith a burst of adrenaline, you lunge at her and knock her into the rusted railings that groan in protest. In return, she lets out a pained howl that reverberates throughout the center, causing dust to fly from the ceiling and the devices to vibrate. You hear a clatter, and turn to see the skeleton skewered on the emitter shatter on the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, the cultist sits up against the railing. You turn to look at her, and she stares back. With a sudden realization and a curled \u201csmile\u201d on her face, she gloats slowly, \u201cyou\u2019ve been converted too\u2026 unwillingly?\u201d It seems as if her features, under the swaying lights, are growing more and more human-like\u2026 \u201cYou know, I-\u201d\n\nYou shake those corrupted thoughts from your mind and tackle her again, driving her partially through the railings. She lets out one last long, piercing wail before you kick the rest of her body into the dark abyss of the emitter\u2019s cooling machinery. Upon hearing her cry cut off abruptly, you collapse against the control panel and let out a wheezing breath.\n\nThe machine is up and running, you have hit the start button while the monster was falling through the darkness, and it hums rather loudly. The engine box clatters and groans, but you didn\u2019t care. It was only needed for this final communication, anyway. Shortly after, Az connects up with you. He looks surprised at your disheveled state, but you wave weakly for him to not worry. \u201cJust, stop the explosion,\u201d you manage to breathe hoarsely.\n\nThe station tremors, sending your weak figure to the floor again, where you lay, vision swimming. You see Az nodding, turning to assign some \u201ccleanup crew\u201d. The cracks and screeching of the station as it gets torn apart seems to drift far away from you, echoing through a layer of hallucinatory water\u2026\n\nThe last thing you see is Az\u2019s relieved smile at the dispatch success, and the bright light that consumes you along with everything else in the station.\n", "Run": "You look out toward the strange orb in the square, and your fears intensify. The voices draw closer, and you make a run through it. Crashing through the window and hitting the ground running, you blaze through the rundown buildings and clogged alleys. The voices were never far, though: shouts and calls echo through the steel complex as the people coordinate to hunt you down. The two children, more nimble than the others, trails behind you closely, their shrill laughter drifting in and out through the sound of your heart pounding in your chest.\n\nAs you round a bend, the shadows shift. A dark figure springs from the gloom and tackles you to the ground, sharp fingernails pricking you through the suit. You find yourself face to face with one of the inner circle cultists from before, and you shudder at the unbearable stench that they carry. The woman-like creature hisses in your face, but you manage to wrestle her off with a burst of adrenaline, holding her flimsy frame at arm\u2019s length. With a shout, you hurl the creature into a wall where it collapses, and you bolt down the alley.\n\n\u2014\n\nYou take refuge in the empty launch bay, panting beside your travel pod, the silence of the abandoned lobby infinitely more welcoming after your run in with the cultists. Along the way, a matter became very clear to you. The cultists weren\u2019t the original populace, at least not the entirety of it - all signs point to Saturn A\u2019s inhabitants fleeing the station outward into space.\n\nYou hesitate to stay, but the emitter is also in the heart of the station, which is why you were here. With little time to spare, you have to decide quickly.\n", "Try to find the emitter": "You had seen it on your frantic escape from the slums, its large spike piercing into the gloom, casting a large and intimidating shadow over much of the city. While menacing, it helped you roughly estimate its location to a discrete sector on the border of the security sectors and the cultist infested hovels.\n\nIt was a risky gamble to venture into the depths of the station again, especially with those devilish fanatics on the lookout, but you resolved to contact the Togens in any way possible.\n\n\u2014\n\nSaturn A is an old station, built many years before the others. Their emitter, too, was of an older model. Due to technological constraints at the time of its construction, engineers had to massively increase the size of the machine.\n\nThe one before you had fallen into disrepair, with a thin layer of dust coating the various dashboards and contraptions, a rare sight in a mostly metallic station. The main pillar stretched into the sky with approximately double the length of the one on Pluto, ending in a sharp point that pierced through a corpse from years ago that had largely decomposed.\n\nIt isn't a pretty sight, but most of the controls are about the same as before. You fire up the device with little difficulty, but it gives no sign of life.\n\nJust as you are getting slightly worried, the main engine jumps with a familiar hum, then a rumble, and the crackles. The box glows warmly, and a quick peek from the control platform affirms your worst expectations - it burns. You waste no time in trying to fight the fire from outside, but the malfunctions don\u2019t end there - embers crawl up through the cables that accompany the obelisk up, causing it, too, to begin smoking and crackling. It makes contact with some strange contraptions near the top of the center, causing them too to spew dark smoke and sparks into the air.\n\n\u201cFuck, a perfect firework show for those maniacs,\u201d you curse, ditching the engine box. Before they arrive, you manage to form a small blockade up to the control panel, clinging on to a faint hope that it would connect at the last second. The Togens never came, but the cultists did.\n\nUnder the command of the members of the \u201cinner circle\u201d (one of which you recognized as your ambusher from before), they dismantle your attempts at keeping them out, and capture you through the sheer power of numbers.\n\nAs you get carried off the platform, the engine hums once more, and collapses in a blaze, and the machine, along with your hopes, are no more.\n\nThe cultists kept you for a few hours after that, performing a few strange rituals and inspections of your body. Eventually, however, they cast you to the same fate as the corpse atop the emitter.\n", "Where did they go?": "The original inhabitants, it seemed, had plenty of time to prepare before some sort of evacuation. Had they known in advance that the sun was doomed? You decide to find out, spending your last hours looking in the station.\n\nYou hadn\u2019t seen it on your first time around, but various pieces of information pointed to them having known - the last broadcasts still playing in some TV\u2019s, electronic newspapers that you could download from the system\u2026\n\nYou piece together as much of the story as you can. Soon after the meeting where the merchants pitched the \u201cdeal\u201d to all of humanity\u2019s leaders, scientists on Saturn B discovered some strange signs from the Sun. Looking back, it had started to show signs of illness as early as a year after experiments began. The scientists were silenced quickly afterward, presumably by the merchants. However, Saturn\u2019s inhabitants were alerted to this danger, and began to secretly prepare for countermeasures. The government devoted massive amounts of resources and manpower to developing engines and spaceships, and with your contributions from the Togens, they were able to construct ships capable of traveling interstellar distances with ease.\n\nCommunications broke off with other stations due to an \u201caccident\u201d on behalf of the merchants. It was said that ships would find themselves spiralling out of path when attempting to travel from station to station. Essentially, humanity has been separated into isolated islands on their own.\n\nThe part that piqued your curiosity the most, though, was the strange orb in the slums. It had barely been mentioned in any of your sources save for one. No one knows when or how, but a strange altar with the orb appeared in the townsquare of the slums. It was reported that the inhabitants fell with a strange illness of weakness within days of having the alien object in their vicinity, while others suffered from paralysis. A few excavation teams came and went, but all failed to remove it, finding it to be deeply rooted in the ground. Shortly after, 7 civilians vanished into thin air.\n\nIt was there that all sources, even newspapers, were cut off. Saturn\u2019s authorities had just received a tip from insiders in the SSA that the sun was on a path to demise, confirming their worst fears. Wasting no time, a complete evacuation of the station was planned and enacted, ferrying humanity\u2019s seed out in all directions into space over a period of a month. Much of the population was sent out on the ships, but a fraction willingly stayed behind\u2026\n\nYou stand immediately after reading this. By your calculations, the last to depart should have only made it to Pluto\u2019s orbit. While far and probably safe from the explosion of a diseased star, you feel the need to meet up with them. The sun will blow in the time you make it there, but\n\n\u2014\n\nYour pod gently docks to the landing bay of the massive ship, drawing some apprehension and curiosity from the people on board as you step down to the artificially gravitated dock. A mix-matched group of regular civilians and flight staff pop their heads from behind windows or railings, and you wave with a smile.\n\nImmediately, a woman shrieks in terror and turns to run, accompanied by a few children. All the crew that had shown their heads suddenly drew them back, slamming doors and whipping curtains shut in your direction. \u201cHow strange,\u201d you thought, walking to an entrance to explain yourself.\n\nThrough the reflection on the door, you see it. A light, hunched figure standing behind you, still. You jump and turn around, startled, finding yourself face to face with a man of similar physical appearance as the cultists from Saturn\u2019s depths. He stands, bent and desolate, but you hear no breath from him. Instead, a periodic thumping from his chest, powerful and unnatural, reverberates as the only sound present in the empty dock entrance.\n\nYou take a step back, and he makes no move. Another step, no response. Feeling uneasy, you turn for your third step, and he disappears from your peripheral vision. The next moment, you crash into a wall with your left arm painfully bent at a strange angle. The monster stands in your place, fist outstretched, pausing for a few more moments before lunging at you again.\n\nYou fire a couple of times before he reaches you, but they seem to bounce off of the man\u2019s elastic pale skin. You struggle feebly against the floor as he lands a few more blows that causes the ground to shudder, and you close your eyes.\n"}, "tree": {"Ambassador": {"Continue": {"Peace Talks": "END", "Push Through": {"Check out the room": "END", "Stay back": {"Saturn": {"Attempt to \"join\" them temporarily": {"Pray to the orb": "END", "ignore it": "END"}, "Run": {"Try to find the emitter": "END", "Where did they go?": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Island Attack: Escape", "stories": {"Beginning": "Before we start, a few things about the game.

They are responsible for the protection of the city against invaders from above, or around, but there hasn't been an altercation since 2103, nearly twenty years ago. Manufacturing: The builders of all new structures, machines, modes of transport, and even weapons, but that is just a rumor floating on the Visor. The Visor is the central hub of communications between all users. The only group of people who don't use it are the Nightingales: The resistance group that fights against the martial law set by the Korr Federation. The final District is Transport: This is basically the unused District in the whole city. It was once the bridge to the other cities, but since the altercation in 2103, the District was shut down, and now only the homeless, criminals, and people who couldn't be repaired reside there.

Outside the windows, the darkness of space is gone, there is only light. You raise your arm to cover your eyes, but as you do, the light pales. Instead of searing your eyes like a thousand suns, the endless expanse of white outside the windows gives off a soft light, like looking at a white plaster wall that someone is shining a torch on.\n\nAs your eyes adjust to this strange phenomena, you hear a gasping, gurgling sound from behind you. Glancing to one side, you see the strangest thing. The right hand half of the cockpit is stretched out before and behind you. Your co-pilot, his chair and console, are now lines and blobs of horizontal colour, stretching through the room in streaks, like a motion-blurred, time-lapse photograph!\n\nYour head goes dizzy as your eyes and brain try to make sense of what it is you are seeing, then suddenly the strange warping of space stops, and the entire cockpit looks normal and whole once more. However, your co-pilot, his body restored to its correct physical form, sags forward in his chair, held up by his chest-crossing seatbelt buckle. Blood trickles from the corners of his mouth as his head drops forward, staring sightlessly down at his console.\n\nOutside the ship, the pale light - the endless expanse of whiteness instead of the blackness of space - tells you that something is horribly wrong here.\n", "Examine Karl's body.": "You move from your console, over to beside your co-pilot. You lift up his head so you can look in his eyes. His head, fully illuminated by the pale light shining in through the windows, stares back at you, seeing nothing.

The device is supposed to monitor life signs, as well as the surrounding environment, and it tells you that his heart has stopped. Karl is clearly dead.\n", "Bring up a ship damage report on your console, and try to find out what is wrong with the ship.": "Sitting in your chair, you bring up the ship status display, and look for signs of damage. For a moment you just look at the screen, unable to believe what it is saying. According to the screen, nothing exists behind the ship's cockpit. The rest of the ship is simply gone... vanished... non-existant!\n\n'How can that be?' you think to yourself.

You look out the window again, at the vast expanse of whiteness that seems to stretch out endlessly in every direction. There's nothing out there but pale, white light.\n\nWhat is this place? Is this Light Space, the other dimension, that ships pass through when they jump? Did your ship somehow become stuck in this dimension, half-way through the jump procedure?

Lights in the ceiling illuminate the steel passage. Metal grating panels on the floor allow access to various wires and cables that run through the ship, beneath your feet. Door hatches are set into the passage walls at different points along its length, leading to various rooms aboard the ship. Far at the other end, you see a large hatch, that opens into the cargo bay at the other end of the starship.\n\nEverything looks completely - suddenly there is a shearing of light and form, as a section of wall about half way down the passage blurs outwards into the passage, in an array of colourful streaking lines - then suddenly flattens out again to look like a normal section of wall once more. Perhaps things aren't as completely normal as they seem...\n\nYou say a short prayer that the motion blurring phenomena won't happen anywhere near you.\n", "Start walking down the passageway.": "You step out of the cockpit and into the passageway. As you move through the doorway, you feel a strange sensation, like stepping through a thin wall of water.\n", "Continue down the passageway": "You decide to continue down the passageway. A few metres along, you reach door hatches on both sides of the passage. One is your sleeping quarters, the other is Karl's. An image of his dead face, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, flashes before your eyes. You take a deep breath, and calm yourself. You know you will need to keep a level head if you are going to get out of this alive.\n", "Remain in the Cockpit for a while, just to be safe - that is, if anywhere on this ship is safe...": "After seeing what the strange warping phenomena did to Karl, and seeing the wall bulge in a similar way further down the passage, you are not too sure it would be safe to walk through the starship.\n\nHowever, as you stand in the Cockpit, wondering what to do, you realise a few things. Firstly, if you stay here, there's no guarantee that the air around you won't warp, and you won't be killed. Secondly, if you are stuck half-way between a Light Space Jump, then the only way out that you can think of, would be to reactivate the Jump Drive, and hope that it finishes the jump, and returns you to normal space.\n\nHowever, the Jump Drive Chamber is at the rear of the ship, to one side of the Cargo Bay. That means, if it is possible to reactivate the drive, you will have to travel through the ship to get to it...

You hear a sound, like someone gasping in surprise, and look up from your console. Your co-pilot, Karl, is looking intently at his console, and doesn't seem to have heard anything unusual. You must have imagined the sound, for you and Karl are the only two people aboard this starship.\n\n\"Jump calculations are complete,\" Karl says to you, sitting in the co-pilots seat beside yours.\n\nBefore you, the transparent plasglass windows of the cockpit provide a view of the stars. Space stretches on infinitely before you. Directly in the middle of your foreward view, a star shines brighter than the others - it is your destination, the closest star to the star system you are currently in.\n\n\"Preparing to Jump to Light Space,\" you say, mentally going through your pre-jump checklist, as you press buttons and flick switches to the correct settings. You feel the ship beginning to vibrate as the interstellar propulsion system powers up, ready to activate.\n\n\"Activating LSJD,\" you say, pressing the final button. There is the usual flash of white light, and...\n", "Not Quite Right": "You are sitting in your pilot's chair, in the cockpit of the Andromeda, and something is not quite right. Outside the windows, the darkness of space is gone, there is only light. You raise your arm to cover your eyes, but as you do, the light pales. Instead of searing your eyes like a thousand suns, the endless expanse of white outside the windows gives off a soft light, like looking at a white plaster wall that someone is shining a torch on.\n\nAs your eyes adjust to this strange phenomena, you hear a gasping, gurgling sound from behind you. Glancing to one side, you see the strangest thing. The right hand half of the cockpit is stretched out before and behind you. Your co-pilot, his chair and console, are now lines and blobs of horizontal colour, stretching through the room in streaks, like a motion-blurred, time-lapse photograph!\n\nYour head goes dizzy as your eyes and brain try to make sense of what it is you are seeing, then suddenly the strange warping of space stops, and the entire cockpit looks normal and whole once more. However, your co-pilot, his body restored to its correct physical form, sags forward in his chair, held up by his chest-crossing seatbelt buckle. Blood trickles from the corners of his mouth as his head drops forward, staring sightlessly down at his console.\n\nOutside the ship, the pale light - the endless expanse of whiteness instead of the blackness of space - tells you that something is horribly wrong here.\n", "Examine Karl's body.": "You move from your console, over to beside your co-pilot. You lift up his head so you can look in his eyes. His head, fully illuminated by the pale light shining in through the windows, stares back at you, seeing nothing. You release him, letting his head drop back down again.\n\nLooking at his jumpsuit, you examine the body-monitoring device built into the suit. The device is supposed to monitor life signs, as well as the surrounding environment, and it tells you that his heart has stopped. Karl is clearly dead.\n", "Bring up a ship damage report on your console, and try to find out what is wrong with the ship.": "Sitting in your chair, you bring up the ship status display, and look for signs of damage. For a moment you just look at the screen, unable to believe what it is saying. According to the screen, nothing exists behind the ship's cockpit. The rest of the ship is simply gone... vanished... non-existant!\n\n'How can that be?' you think to yourself. After all, the power generators at the rear of the ship must exist, because all the computer systems and life support within the cockpit is functioning just as it always does. The rest of the ship MUST exist!\n\nFrustrated, you turn off the status display.\n", "Check the ship's sensors, and see what it can detect.": "You look at the ship's sensor screen. It shows your ship in the middle of the screen, but shows no signs of planets or stars in the vicinity. In fact, it shows nothing at all, in any direction. You look out the window again, at the vast expanse of whiteness that seems to stretch out endlessly in every direction. There's nothing out there but pale, white light.\n\nWhat is this place? Is this Light Space, the other dimension, that ships pass through when they jump? Did your ship somehow become stuck in this dimension, half-way through the jump procedure? If so, how are you supposed to get out?\n", "Open the cockpit door, and look into the central passageway.": "Feeling a little uncertain as to what you might find, you nervously walk to the rear of the cockpit, and press the door release button. The rear door slides open and...\n\nThe central passageway that runs from the cockpit, through the ship, to the cargo bay at the rear, looks exactly as it always does. Lights in the ceiling illuminate the steel passage. Metal grating panels on the floor allow access to various wires and cables that run through the ship, beneath your feet. Door hatches are set into the passage walls at different points along its length, leading to various rooms aboard the ship. Far at the other end, you see a large hatch, that opens into the cargo bay at the other end of the starship.\n\nEverything looks completely - suddenly there is a shearing of light and form, as a section of wall about half way down the passage blurs outwards into the passage, in an array of colourful streaking lines - then suddenly flattens out again to look like a normal section of wall once more. Perhaps things aren't as completely normal as they seem...\n\nYou say a short prayer that the motion blurring phenomena won't happen anywhere near you.\n", "Start walking down the passageway.": "You step out of the cockpit and into the passageway. As you move through the doorway, you feel a strange sensation, like stepping through a thin wall of water.\n", "Continue down the passageway": "You decide to continue down the passageway. A few metres along, you reach door hatches on both sides of the passage. One is your sleeping quarters, the other is Karl's. An image of his dead face, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, flashes before your eyes. You take a deep breath, and calm yourself. You know you will need to keep a level head if you are going to get out of this alive.\n", "Remain in the Cockpit for a while, just to be safe - that is, if anywhere on this ship is safe...": "After seeing what the strange warping phenomena did to Karl, and seeing the wall bulge in a similar way further down the passage, you are not too sure it would be safe to walk through the starship.\n\nHowever, as you stand in the Cockpit, wondering what to do, you realise a few things. Firstly, if you stay here, there's no guarantee that the air around you won't warp, and you won't be killed. Secondly, if you are stuck half-way between a Light Space Jump, then the only way out that you can think of, would be to reactivate the Jump Drive, and hope that it finishes the jump, and returns you to normal space.\n\nHowever, the Jump Drive Chamber is at the rear of the ship, to one side of the Cargo Bay. That means, if it is possible to reactivate the drive, you will have to travel through the ship to get to it... The fact that the rest of the ship doesn't even show on the ship's computer is in no way reassuring to you.\n"}, "tree": {"Jump Preperations": {"Not Quite Right": {"Examine Karl's body.": {"Bring up a ship damage report on your console, and try to find out what is wrong with the ship.": {"Check the ship's sensors, and see what it can detect.": {"Open the cockpit door, and look into the central passageway.": {"Start walking down the passageway.": {"Turn around.": "END", "Continue down the passageway instead.": "END"}, "Continue down the passageway instead.": {"Open the door to your sleeping quarters.": "END"}}}}, "Continue down the passageway": "END"}, "Remain in the Cockpit for a while, just to be safe - that is, if anywhere on this ship is safe...": {"Start walking down the passageway.": "END"}}}}}, {"title": "Liquid Metal", "stories": {"The Struggle": "Attention Attention!

You grew up on the planet Usul, where you found life on your family's gava rice farm to be dull. You joined the Astral Navy for adventure, but so far you seem to be stuck on an unnamed transport, making routine runs on the same route over and over.\n\n\nBeyond this basic background information, the character is yours to inhabit. Is he or she bold or thoughtful, daring or analytical, confident or plagued by inner doubt? The decisions are yours to make as you navigate the story and learn the multitude of fates that may befall you, your crewmates, and your mission.\n\n\nRemember, the gamebook format was intended to be read more than once. To get the full impact of this story, you should explore many of the storypaths, and not just settle for the first ending you encounter. Yes, there may be a few \"linear\" passages here and there, where you click through several pages without being presented with any options, but overall you will find 19 endings spread out over 140 pages of storytelling.

There are many perils awaiting you on this deserted world, so it may take a combination of skill, luck, and perseverance to succeed in your mission.\n\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy Marooned on Giri Minor, the first entry in The Orion Chronicles.\n\n\n--Bill Ingersoll\n", "A Book of Many Fates": "The Orion Chronicles Part I:\n\n\nMarooned on Giri Minor\n\n\nBill Ingersoll\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(C) 2019 Bill Ingersoll\n\n\nPublished April 2019\n\n\nRevised June 2019\n\n\n \n", "Page 1": "The colors outside the massive viewports on each side of the passenger cabin are fascinating, but you are puzzled why no one else seems as interested in them as you. The ship is traveling through hyperspace, the alternate dimension where the laws of nature permit people to travel much faster than the speed of light. Instead of stars streaking by, your ship seems to be flying through a tunnel of multi-colored clouds. Perhaps no one else is as enthralled as you are because they are all veterans to space travel--to them, this all humdrum stuff.\n\n\nYou are a young technician in the Astral Navy, serving aboard a transport vessel en route to Star Base Ishtria, the headquarters of the Fifth Fleet. You were born and raised on the planet Usul, located a long distance from here; and like many of your people you have an oto leaf emblem pinned on the collar of your duty uniform. On this ship you hold the rank of Starman, which sounds impressive but really means you're a young recruit on your first deep-space assignment, and the youngest member of a 4-person crew.\n\n\nYour primary job here is to serve as steward to the sixteen passengers on this voyage. Right now those passengers are relaxing throughout the cabin--sitting, napping, holding quiet conversations with their neighbors.\n\n\nJust about everybody here is traveling to a new job. There is a team of engineers on their way to Star Base Ishtria, for instance, to study irrigation practices on the Khubu homeworld, and a tactical officer off to a new posting in the Delphid Sector. There by the aft bulkhead is Dr. Lori Munro, a noted xenoanthropologist. She and her husband Ander Dyo are heading to a research mission on the planet Folvan.\n\n\nEven your youngest passengers, little Easa and Yigaro Belson, are returning from an adventure on Cassandria IV, where they have been visiting their aunt and uncle at a paleontological dig on the Southern Continent. They have been telling you all about the fur whale fossils they helped unearth.\n\n\nEverybody, it seems, has come from an interesting place and has someplace important to go--everybody, that is, but you.\n", "Page 2": "Your dream is to land a posting on one of the big Starships, like the Orion or the Southern Cross. That's the only way you really get to see all the exotic worlds and the far star clusters! But those assignments are all highly competitive, and to land one you first need lots of experience.\n\n\nBut how can you gain that experience when they put you on a transport ship that only goes to the same few places over and over again? This ship doesn't even have a name, just a designation: EWR210819. Your biggest responsibility on this voyage is watching after Easa and her older brother Yigaro--who prefers to be called Yiggy. Their father is a commander at Ishtria, and they'll be home the day after tomorrow, when your ship pulls into the spaceport.\n\n\nYou've spent much of the last day playing space games with them, many involving a model of the transport vessel you're on: a long needle-like hull with a ring surrounding the aft, anchored to the hull by four pylons. At the end of each pylon is one of the hyperspace field generators that permit your faster-than-light travel.\n\n\nBut right now you don't even have Easa and Yiggy to worry about, because they've been busy coloring with another one of the passengers, Dionysya Andrade, a newly promoted lieutenant commander on her way to serve as the communications officer aboard the Orion. Commander Andrade probably suspected you needed the break, or maybe the Belson kids reminded her of her own son when he was that age. But it's not like you had any other pressing duties to perform; sometimes you think this little ship would run just fine without you.\n\n\nBack home on Usul your family grows gava rice on a small farm on the Elliott River Delta. Your parents and your older brother seemed content with that lifestyle and were remarkably uncurious about the world around them, let alone the galaxy. Not you, though; you craved challenges and adventure, so as soon as you were old enough you enlisted in the Astral Navy.\n\n\nBut look where it has gotten you. Even here no one seems to find you suitable for more than the most basic tasks.\n", "Page 6": "Then, unexpectedly, you feel the ship slowing. Outside the viewports the tunnel of clouds fades away, revealing an ordinary star field in a black sky. There is an unfamiliar brown planet very close by, and indeed you can tell that the ship is heading into orbit around it.\n\n\nThis is odd, because there were no scheduled stops until the star base. That's when you hear your name on the ship's comm. It's Captain Siggo, the commander of this vessel.\n\n\n\"How's the situation with the Belson kids?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"Fine,\" you reply. \"Right now they're coloring with Commander Andrade.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect. Can you come up to the bridge for a moment?\"\n\n\nYou really like Siggo, although you have a hard time figuring him out. You know he has years of experience in the service, and once even served as a bridge officer aboard the Starship Draco. But that just baffles you all the more, because why would such a person choose an assignment on a routine transport run such as this? He'll never give you a straight answer to that question, and he has a habit of changing a conversation by singing a few lyrics from one of his favorite songs.\n\n\nThe bridge of the transport ship is nothing like on a Starship. It's small and cramped, with stations for just two people. Normally it would be just Siggo and Lieutenant Hatuso manning the controls, although when you arrive right now the captain is by himself.\n\n\n\"Ah, Starman,\" he says, calling you by your rank. \"So here's the situation. Our link with Ishtria went dead a moment ago, so we think there is a malfunction with the communications array on the dorsal pylon. Lieutenant Hatuso and Chief Indrian are suiting up for a spacewalk to see what's going on, because I don't like flying in the blind. I parked us here in the glow of this little dusty world called Giri Minor because we were in the neighborhood and I thought the light would help them with their work.\"\n\n\n\"I see,\" you say.\n\n\nHe continues. \"I know you want more experience so you can get transferred off this boring transport run as quickly as possible. So do you want to suit up with Hatuso and Indrian, or man the helm here with me?\"\n", "Page 30": "An opportunity to go on a spacewalk outside the ship! How could that not be an exciting break in an otherwise routine day?\n\n\n\"Well don't have too much fun that you forget to come back in,\" Siggo says. The last you see him as you bolt down the stairs toward the lower deck, he is turning back toward his control panel singing,\n\n\nSome days you get the sun, others it's just the moon\n\n\nIf life's not spent having fun, it's over too soon.\n", "Page 31": "Lieutenant Mori Hatuso and Petty Officer Tira Indrian are your other two crew mates. You find them in the staging area leading to the airlock, preparing their tools before stepping into their EV suits.\n\n\n\"I see the captain is giving you a break from babysitting,\" Hatuso says. The lieutenant is another person you can't quite get a handle on, perhaps even less so than Captain Siggo. You get the distinct impression he intentionally keeps you at arms length, like you're just the latest in a long line of young recruits he's had to deal with.\n\n\nChief Indrian, on the other hand, is far more personable. She is a young career-minded non-com, with a long and ambitious list of goals and plans; everybody she meets she treats like a potential ally.\n\n\n\"Is this your first walk?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"I've logged tons of hours in the simulator,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Well this will be just a training walk for you,\" she says. \"The lieutenant and I will be doing the repairs.\"\n\n\n\"I'll be happy to do whatever you need me to do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"This is your first walk, so just enjoy the ride.\"\n\n\n\"Just don't enjoy it too much,\" Hatuso says with a wink, \"or you'll be cleaning up the mess inside your suit, if you know what I mean.\"\n"}, "tree": {"Author's Note": {"Marooned on Giri Minor": {"BEGIN STORY": {"Page 2": {"Page 6": {"If you go on the spacewalk to assist in the repairs, turn to page 30.": {"Page 31": {"Page 32": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Mechanised Assault Unit", "stories": {"Introduction": "Gunship Iron Eagle Two roared through sector 205 on the rim of the Mesarius star system. The sleek aerospace vehicle, similar in form to the hi-tech attack copters of the 21st Century, was designed with a swappable engine section, allowing it to be equipped with a spacedrive for stellar travel, or a jet-boost assisted rotor section for duties planetside. Turrets swivelled slowly on either side of the Gunship's hull, mounting missile launchers and an energy cannon, while the small chin-turret at the front, below the cockpit, housed twin-plasmabolt machine guns used in anti-infantry duties while planetside.\n\nKreiger 'Wildcat' Jones sat at the front of the two-man cockpit, one hand on the pilot's joystick, the other tapping occassionally at the keys on the console in front of him. \"I'm telling you, those frontier raiders make no sense at all. I mean, all they have to do is sign up with the Federation and all their supply and maintenance problems are solved! Makes no sense they would fight for political control of a few hundred rocks in space, and waste their lives trying to steal the equipment and supplies they need. I mean, sign on the dotted line, and they get everything for free without a fight, and the planets are still theirs to do with as they please, just with a Fed governor helping make sure things are run right.\"\n\nSusa 'Spitball' Henderson sat in the gunner's seat, behind him, with a complex console that controlled targeting and weapons systems. \"I guess for some people, the 'idea' of independance is more powerful than whatever the facts of the situation might be.\"\n\nJones shook his head in frustration. \"I just don't get it, that's all. We're better armed than they are. We've got better skills, better funding. We're going to defeat them in battle pretty much every time, but raiders keep a'coming. They should all - hey, wait a moment, I got something on the scan.\"\n\nHe tapped a few keys on his console, and zoomed in on one of his displays, where small flashes of light flickered in a section of the grid. \"Hey, we've got Space Folds in the next sector. Better report it in.\"\n\nHenderson turned on a Comm channel back to their carrier. \"Carrier Opal, this is gunship Iron Eagle Two, out in Sector Two-Oh-Five. We've just scanned incoming starships in Sector Two-Oh-Six. Requesting permission to check it out?\"\n\n\"This is carrier Opal, that is affirmitive. Watch your tails,\" the reply came back over the Comm.\n\n\"How many are you reading?\" Henderson asked Jones.\n\n\"Looks like four Space Folds detected. If it's a typical raider force, what, two transports, two of their rickety old gunships, we should be able to take 'em out or send 'em packing,\" Jones said confidently. Leaning softly on the joystick, he arced the gunship toward the sensor readings, and kicked on the afterburners. The Iron Eagle gunship rocketed forward and into the next sector.\n\n\"There they are,\" he said, seeing starship blips appearing on his radar. \"Hang on... these readings can't be right. Can you get some info on your tac console?\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Henderson said, tapping away on her console. \"What the - that can't be right at all. I think our scanner's gone screwy. The scale's all gone wrong.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Jones asked hesitantly.\n\n\"This says those ships are huge... I mean, the smallest one is five times the size of our carrier!\" she replied.\n\n\"That can't be right, we've got no ships that big, and the raiders certainly don't have anything like that... Let's get a bit closer, try to get a visual.\" Jones increased the thrust, closing toward the four unknown starships. \"Coming into Optical range... now,\" he said, and zoomed in on the target location on one of his displays. What he saw was like nothing he had ever seen before. He took a few screen capture images.\n\n\"I've taken some shots, send these images back to the Opal, right now!\" he ordered.\n\n\"Transmitting data,\" she said, reaching for a button on her console. Something streamed out from one of the unidentified starships, like a beam of concentrated sunlight. The beam engulfed the Iron Eagle. It left nothing behind.\n", "On Patrol": "It is a typical sunny Mesarian day, a soft breeze rustling leaves and causing the branches of the trees surrounding Fort Dale to sway softly. You walk from the barracks toward the large three-story high mecha hanger by the east walls of the complex, wondering why frontiersman would live on the desolate outer star systems, when they could live on the core worlds and enjoy weather like this. Well, I guess it takes all sorts to make the galaxy go round, you think to yourself.\n\nEntering the hanger, you pause to look up at the twelve Mechanised Assault Units, standing in bays on each side of the hanger. They are standard Fire Hawk and Gatling chassis, the first a multi-role fighting machine, the latter often used for anti-infantry, or anti-gunship purposes. At the rear of the hanger is a thirteenth bay, where the company commander's large M.A.U., a Nova, is parked. Bearing two large energy cannons, and standing almost to the roof of the hanger, it is the toughest M.A.U. fielded by Sol Federation. Of course, it takes the skill and experience of a company commander to pilot such a mecha. At least, that's what your C.O. tells you all.\n\n'Tomcat' and 'Wolfman' walk into the hanger, waving your way as they head for their machines. As the Squad Leader, you are in charge of the fort's M.A.U. Squad Beta, and as your two squadmates, they are under your command. Of course, being about the same age as you are, and having served for about the same amount of time as you have, they don't exactly obey your every whim. At least they obey you when it counts though, when raiders land ground forces on the planet, and you find yourself in the heat of battle.\n\nTurning to your left, you head for a small lift, and slap the 'up' button. It rises upward, taking you behind the torso section of your Gatling M.A.U. The war machine stands like a 7 metre (23 foot) high metal man, with rectangular armour plating panels slapped around joints and further protecting the chest section. Pressing some buttons on the back of the machine, a two-foot thick section of metal slides aside, letting you step into the chest of the machine.\n\nYou're already wearing your Pilot Suit, so you close the door behind you, and connect sensor cables to the sockets in your suit, and attach the control pads to the wrists of your suit. The control pads extend out below your hand, allowing you to move your hands about, and always be able to touch the buttons on the control pad that control every facet of the war machine, from targeting and firing weapons, to powering the machine up or down. The suit itself is harnessed to the inside of the machine, locking you into place. After powering up, any time you try to move a part of your body, the limbs of the towering war machine will echo the move. In this way, trying to walk will cause the machine to walk instead of you. Moving your body just the right amount to get the machine to move exactly where and when you want it to is a difficult art, and one that took years of boot-camp training to accomplish, but for a low-level Squad Leader, you think you do pretty good.\n\nBefore locking your suit into place, you attach your head equipment, and then you lock the suit, and power up. Instantly your vision goes blank, as your headset pulses into your skull, and interrupts the signals your optic nerves send to your brain. Then it begins to send signals of its own into your brain, as it reads optical information from the camera systems in the head of your war machine.\n\nA moment later, you suddenly feel very big, as you 'look' through the 'eyes' of your Gatling M.A.U., seven meters above the floor of the hanger. You try to turn your head from side to side, and the Gatling's head turns instead, allowing you to look around. Flexing your limbs a bit, you crouch the machine, stand back up, and wave the arms about a little. Everything seems to be in working order. Time to move out.\n\nYou step forwards, and the machine steps into the middle of the hanger bay. Tomcat and Wolfman walk their Fire Hawks out beside you, and together the three of you stomp out of the hanger.\n\n\"So, Squad Leader, where are we going to patrol today?\" Wolfman's voice comes over your headset.\n", "\"Let's go for a walk in the forests around the Fort,\" you order.": "You lead the squad to the towering gates of the Fort. \"This is Squad Beta, requesting Gate Clearance,\" you say to the fort's traffic control tower.\n\n\"We read you, Squad Beta. You're good to go,\" someone replies. The massive gates slide into the Fort's surrounding wall, and you lead your squad out. A large clearing lies between the Fort's walls and the forest that surrounds it, so that any approaching vehicles can always be seen. You lead your men down the main road and into the forest, among the equally towering trees. It's a funny thing, being at eye-level with the tops of many of the trees, and it always takes you a moment to get your balance right, and for the feeling of being a giant to become natural.\n\nMany of the trees are toppled over throughout the forest, from people having stomped out among the trees. Being a three-story high metal man means that you often have to push trees out of the way. While conservationists might have a problem with such actions in some areas of the planet, no one complains when soldiers do it around a fort, as they depend on the forts scattered across the planet for protection, and you never knew if a raider force had secretly touched down, and enemy M.A.U.s were hiding among the trees, waiting for an opportunity to strike.\n\nWell, actually, that sort of thing was pretty rare. The Orbital sensor network always detected incoming ships, and could pinpoint the exact landing location of any military transports on the planet. Anyway, you stomp off among the trees, shoving them out of the way whenever you need to make room for your machine. Wolfman and Tomcat stomp along, off to either side of you.\n\n\"One of these days, we're gonna find a raider mecha waiting for us out here, and patrol is going to actually be interesting,\" Tomcat laughs.\n\n\"Hey, anything beats sitting around the barracks, losing at cards to Thunder,\" Wolfman replies.\n\nSuddenly a ComTech from the Fort speaks over the Fort's military channel. \"This is Fort Dale to all units on patrol. Be advised, the planetary sensor network has detected unidentified incoming starships. We haven't been able to establish contact with the carrier scout network... This could be a raider force. Stand By for possible interception coordinates.\"\n\n\"I hope they land in our sector... haven't seen any action in months now,\" Tomcat says.\n\n\"Hang on, did they say they couldn't establish communcations with the carrier scout network? What does that mean? A raider force couldn't take out all the carriers and gunships out there. I haven't heard of them being able to jam our communications either,\" Wolfman says worriedly.\n\n\"Nah, probably just a technical glitch at our Fort. The other Fort's probably heard all about it from the scout network,\" Tomcat says dismissively.\n\nThe ComTech at Fort Dale speaks over the military channel again. \"All units on patrol, be advised the planet has been taken to High Alert. We don't know what those ships are up there, but they're huge! Dozens of smaller ships, we assume they're military transports, have come out of the mothers, and are coming down all across the planet. We've got a couple of these transports inbound toward our location. Keep an eye on the skies, people, and if you get in over your head, get back here, and take up defensive positions inside the Fort! The other pilots at Fort Dale are mounting up, and should be ready for action soon.\"\n\n\"What the hell? Multiple transports heading our way? What exactly are we up against?\" Wolfman asks anxiously.\n\n\"Hey, frontier raiders aren't well armed. They're probably just small transports, full of infantry. We'll mow them down, and be back to the Fort for dinner in no time,\" Tomcat says confidently.\n", "\"No, I think Wolfman's right to be worried. Let's head back to the Fort, and take up a defensive position with the rest of our M.A.U. company,\" you order.": "You lead the way back to the Fort. Seeing you coming across the clearing around Fort Dale, Traffic Control opens the doors for you, and you stomp your way into the walled complex. Only a few minutes later, you pick up approaching blips on the scanner hud display which is 'projected' into your mind by your headset, in the corner of your 'vision'. Four large unidentified transports are heading toward the Fort.\n\nYou listen to the roaring of flying machines on your M.A.U.'s audio sensors, approaching from the east. The other ten M.A.U.'s of Fort Dale's company have marched out of the Hanger, and begin taking up positions around the perimeter, their outstretched weapon-bearing arms just above the walls of the Fort, pointing in every direction. You quickly take up a position with your squad, along the east wall.\n\nMoments later, you can see the four massive transports. They are about the size of a squad-carrying M.A.U. transport, but they are a bit bulkier and boxier than any M.A.U. transports you've seen before.\n\nIn the Fort's courtyard, the infantry division assemble, about a hundred soldiers. Most of them were standard infantry bearing plasmabolt rifles and shocksticks, but a dozen or so were fitted up in battlesuits - three meter tall armoured exoskeltons with clawed robotic hands, and small energy cannons attached to each shoulder.\n\nAt the rear of the Fort, another hanger houses a Gunship squad. The six flying machines had just finished powering up and begin to lift up into the air to intercept the enemy transports. Suddenly a thick bolt of lightening blasts out from the nose of the leading enemy transport ship. The lightning crackles loudly as it arcs through the air toward Fort Dale, to explode in the midst of the Gunships! The lightning bolt narrowly misses the Gunships, their pilots scattering the ships away from each other, but two pilots panic, and you watch in horror as their ships crash together in the air, then tumble in a wreck of twisted metal and fire, to crash onto the tarmac.\n\nSome of the other M.A.U. soldiers open fire with their weapons. Your company commander, Captain Jefferson, yells out over the local military channel, \"Hold your fire! They're out of range! Save your ammo and power cells! Everyone, get down!\"\n\nYou join with your company as everyone kneels their M.A.U. war machines behind the Fort's wall. The remaining four Gunships fold down their rotors, and kick on their afterburners, rocketing through the air toward the enemy transports. You watch them fly overhead, then lose sight of them due to the Fort's walls. You hear the roar of the afterburners kick off again as the Gunships draw near to the flying transports, and listen to energy cannons and missiles firing away. A while later, you hear the loud crack of another lightning strikes, and some explosions. Then there is a tremendous crashing sound, and the ground shakes.\n\n\"Looks like it takes them a while to recharge that lightning cannon. Someone get a look at what's happening out there!\" Captain Jefferson orders.\n", "\"I'll do it,\" you say bravely, and stand your M.A.U. up to look over the Fort's walls.": "You quickly stand up and look out over the walls of Fort Dale through the eyes of your Gatling war machine.\n\n\"Sir, the Gunships are all down, but it looks like they took out one of the enemy transports!\" you report, looking at the smoke and flames rising from the distant fields beyond the forest. Three of the large transports are hovering in the air near the wreckage. Then you see some sort of flickering light at the front of one of the transports.\n", "Curious, you decide to keep watching, and see what it does next.": "Seconds later, you remember about it's strange energy weapon, and then you watch as the weapon finishes charging up, and a massive bolt of lightning surges through the air with a loud crack. It is the last sound you ever hear, as the lightning bolt blasts the top half of your M.A.U. to scrap, taking most of your body with it.\n\nThis is the end, for you...\n", "You decide not to take any risks, and crouch back down behind the wall.": "As you crouch back down, you hear a loud cracking sound, as the weapon that had been charging up finished charging, and launches one of the massive lightning bolts through the air. The searing electrical beam blasts through the air where you were standing moments ago, and smashes into one of the armoured buildings in the middle of the Fort. A large fiery hole is blown through the side of the building, as debris scatters into the courtyard, among screaming infantry. The rest of the infantry and battlesuit wearing soldiers run for cover.\n\n\"Damn it! How can they shoot so far! Who the hell are they?\" Captain Jefferson growls over the Comm. Then the ground shakes again - the familiar shaking of massive spaceships landing on the ground in the distance.\n\n\"Okay, they've touched down in the fields out past the forest... That means there's lines of trees between us and whatever ground forces they've brought down. We won't know what's coming until they reach the clearing around Fort Dale,\" the Captain says. He cautiously raises his Nova M.A.U. so that its head can peek above the wall.\n\n\"Those transports are so big, more than half of their hull rises above the tree line. I suspect they'll keep barraging the Fort with that lightning cannon of theirs, while their troops advance. Intel has it they are coming down all across the planet, so we've got to hold Fort Dale, because there aint going to be reinforcements coming our way any time soon. So, I'm gonna need two squads to volunteer. I want a squad to take turns looking over the wall for incoming enemies, and I need a squad for scout duty, to try and get a closer look at what we're dealing with before they reach us.\"\n", "\"Sir! Squad Beta will scout out the enemy,\" you volunteer.": "\"Oh, great!\" Wolfman says, and you smile as his mecha shakes its head.\n\n\"Good job, Squad Leader,\" Captain Jefferson says. \"Head east into the trees, and try to get us some optics on the enemy. I want you three to patch an optic channel back here to Fort Dale, so myself and the other officers can see what you see.\"\n\n\"Will do, Captain,\" you reply, and flick a switch on one of your control pads. A blinking light in the corner of your vision tells you that your mecha is transmitting everything you see to the commanders of the Fort.\n\n\"Okay Squad Beta, form on me!\" you order, and Wolfman and Tomcat take a position on either side of you. The large gate in the south wall slowly slides open.\n\n\"Good luck, men,\" the Captain says.\n"}, "tree": {"Introduction": {"On Patrol": {"\"Let's go for a walk in the forests around the Fort,\" you order.": {"\"No, I think Wolfman's right to be worried.

Now, my training is starting to be a proud member of the Empire.\" You continue repeating like a trained monkey what the Empire want to hear. If only, you could tell the truth. You close your clenched fists, trying to hide your true feelings behind an armour of nervousness.\n", "Your mind gets lost, rememebering the lab, and her...": "Heavy hands press the release button of your helmet, freeing you. An overwhelming white light blinds your eyes accustomed to the darkness for an entire hour, and you are definitely in a high-tech laboratory. But for now, your main concern is her.\n\nIn front of you, there is a cyborg woman dressed in an immaculate white translucent lab jumpsuit that leaves little to the imagination, and nightmares. The woman could be better described as a piece of rancid lard with legs with titanium legs to help her carry her extended belly, while her flaccid breasts remind you of fallen deflated bags of water. A slug with a human form, you doubt that someone could dare to find something like that attractive.\n\nShe sees your gaze and begins to touch her entire body trying to look provocative, while you try to control your desire to vomit before such a display of her revealing the pustules, body hair and fat covering the human flesh of her cyborg body.\n\n\"You are a very special creature and probably the only person in the Divine mega station that can understand my situation.\" Her voice is now warmer and passionate. Now if you have questions, you will not have opportunities later... She smiles evilly, looking at you with desire in her strange eyes.\nIn front of you a portal black and brilliant moving like if it were made by water... AS you fall, you can feel its energy calling you to fulfil your destiny.\n\n***\n\nYou wake up lost and stunned Without a doubt, the fat woman has made you cross the portal unconscious.\n\nEverything around you disappears into an intangible nothingness, you simply float in a strange chasm, waddled by some kind of flickering energy, it is nothing a mortal can explain. Time is somehow nonexistent here, but you run restless, as you feel like you have to do something, or being consumed by the void.\n\nDo I have to do something? Why does nothing happen? Will I be one of the failures that are unable to become Gods? All these feelings bite your consciousness until the mere fact of thinking is a nightmare.\n\nThe murderbowl is the most refined system that the Empire has created to refine the best candidates to fight to become gods. But even so, sometimes there are failures. In which violent supernovae occur at the limit of the Galaxy. Other heroes appear changed, transformed into monsters that are a mere parody of their previous power.\n\n\"I may be another failure... But, something inside me tries to light up and screams to do something. Do something? Being a god cannot be as easy as snapping my fingers and seeing how an authentic beer appears on my hand.\" You mutter to yourself\n\n\"WTF!\" You can't avoid screaming even though the lack of air makes it impossible for any sound to be heard, but in your left hand, there is a beautiful and cold bottle of beer like those that you remember that your father drank when you were a small child before you You were considered undesirable, and the future for you was bright and heroic, full of great food and beer in your hand, several slaves and a big family.\n\nYou open the bottle and taste it with your mind lost in your past. The family, you lost forever. A father, a mother a good house on the mother planet with vineyards and a good flat in a good neighbourhood station in Divine.\n\nThe bubbling golden liquid tastes bittersweet, to honey and a home, but it is also a memory of all that I have lost. Or what I can earn. If I become God, I can be what my own planet wants to have, and eventually create my own family.\n\nSuddenly, little by little, the darkness changes, like the dawn of your planet Reah, which fascinated you so much to see working outside the stadium; now there is a warm and beautiful yellow light like the yolk of fried eggs that your mother cooked for you as a child; you have created your star and you decide to call it Uxis, like the cat, you had as a child.\n\n\"So you got it, do you really think that you are better than me? This can't be happening!\" You can listen to the stinky fat woman; but thank God, you can't see her. You don't even know how you can hear her voice in your head.\n", "***": "\"Cut, the interview! Are you okay? Your stress is through the roof. For now, this is enough, Guybrush.\"\n\nThe connection is broken, but the magic continues to surround you like an unhealthy gas. You sit down with an authentic dwarf beer as you gaze out the window of your sumptuous palace, hundreds of slaves and tourists milling around the luxurious facilities of the city under your full control. Your people, your planet. Your power\u2026\"\n\n\"Sir, Corgi is here! The empire has decided what to do with you.\" The mechanical maid leaves with elaborate courtesy.\n", "The message from the Gods": "Even the marble statues in your main hall plug their ears in shock at the young nobleman sweating near your brand new throne.\n\n\"Are you sure about this Corgi?!\" you comment surprised the young aristocrat sweating after running around the palace\n\"I came via teleportation from the capital when I found out about the decision of the Council of Gods. But I don't know what you are surprised about, Guybrush, it was clear that the Gods were not going to let you be, not after a Janitor transform into God... Damn, I don't even understand how you ended up deep in this shit. \"\n\nYou blink in disbelief until your eyes sting. You see your hands still showing calluses and discolourations caused by years of using thousands of chemicals polishing and cleaning every atom of the Arena where the heroes earn their promotion to the gods. It's only been a month since you created your first planet, saving your head out of a pure miracle.\n", "\"Oh shit!\"": "Nervous, your hands are shaking without control, before you even notice it, a box of Scented Detergent made from real cirrhotic man dander appearing your hands, falling in cascades onto Corgi's golden robe.\n\n\"Sting, this HURTS horrors! What the hell have you done Guybrush!\" Poor Corgi's voice echoes over the immense hallway decorated with Doric colonnades and neon trees glowing like 24-hour brothel signs.\n\n\"I'm ... sorry, when I get nervous my powers become unstable,\" you sigh trying to fix it, while your hands shake like liquid jelly on a washing machine spinning.\n\n\"Good thing your powers are to create cleaning products; I have to remove this robe before I lose my skin.\"\n"}, "tree": {"MESSIAH FOR HIRE": {"The interview": {"Keep the interview going.": {"Your mind gets lost, rememebering the lab, and her...": {"***": {"The message from the Gods": {"\"Oh shit!\"": {"Shout out to the service to come at once": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Mind Games", "stories": {"The Background": "Your 18 years old and you live in a city in Southeast England. You have recently moved to live closer to the University where you study programming. You live with a couple mates in a flat. Jared is a new friend you have met since starting the university course and is rather stocky, above average height, likes outdoors and plays rugby in a club at the University, he is also rather social and has many friends of his own. Because he is rather busy, he doesn't have much time for studying and generally prefers to work anyway even if he does have time to spare. He works as a bouncer at the local club and enjoys throwing people out of club. Although it can get fairly rough he likes it that way, as it makes his job generally more interesting. This is how he managed to contribute to the monthly rent for the flat.\n\nJack the other friend that lives with you, is rather the opposite of Jared. He has a couple friends but most of the time just keeps to himself. He does computer programming like you and spends most of his time on the computer. He isn't involved in any extra activities and generally studies harder than Jared because of this. He somehow manages to contribute to the rent by selling lots of items on ebay but occasionally he fails to keep up with the rent, as he has no job. Because of this Jared can sometimes get a bit angry because he feels he is doing all the work, which is pretty understandable.\n\nThe flats itself is rather untidy and at the present time beer cans line the table in the middle of the living room. The flat consists of three bedrooms, a living area, a kitchen and a bathroom. A TV is at the back of the room with a picture of the titanic above the TV nailed into the wall. A stained rug is underneath the central wooden table, stained mainly because Jared gets drunk and starts to tip his drink everywhere. Party's used to take place at the flat but Jack got rather fed up and threatened to leave if they continued. After that they never had any Party's.\n\nPresently Jack is in the kitchen with its cupboards and work surfaces out of date. He is struggling to make an egg sandwich. \"What\u2019s up dude?\" I casually ask.\n\n\"I can't bloody get this dam egg to fry\" He says sweating promptly. He tosses the egg around the saucepan like a TV chef except they don't normally get the egg on the floor. \"Ahhhhh look what you made me d\no!\" Jack accuses me and points his stubby finger against your chest. \"I spent ages doing that\" He rants and raves for a while, storming around the small kitchen. At this moment Jared decides to enter the flat and proceeds to move towards the kitchen to grab a beer. He spots us and immediately moves to stand in the way of Jack and me in case of a potential fight. He would never punch or hurt me or Jack due to his kind nature, but just merely his presence, with his massive shoulders and thick stocky build and the fact he towers over me and Jack, causes Jack to storm off into the his bedroom, slamming the door on the way out.\n\n\"Well looks like you sissies can't take a laugh\" Jared comments to me. \"Listen mate I'm going to be in charge of a rugby match tonight and your welcome to come along. I promise not to break any bones\" Jared's casual tone has been replaced with a serious look.\n\nYou could try to patch up your friendship with Jack or you could go to Jared's rugby match. You really need to think about this one.\n", "The rugby match": "You\u2019re on the green average sized rugby pitch and it seems Jared is remarkably pleased you came along. He's in the middle of coaching the two teams and giving them all the tips. As he finishes his prematch talk he then sends the rugby players to warm up on the spot and jog around the pitch a couple of laps. While he is waiting he comes over to you. \"Glad you could make it sport\" as Jared says this he pats you on the back. \"Yeah well you know I thought it sounded fun\" you reply. \"There's only one problem though\" you continue. \"What\u2019s that mate?\" .\"I haven't actually got any trainers to wear, I got some kit but nothing to wear on my feet\" you explain nervously. \"Well can't you ask one of the boys?\" he reply\u2019s casually. \"I already did but nobody would lend me any, not even a pair of old boots that weren\u2019t in use anymore\". \"YOU WHAT! THE BOYS DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY BOOTS!\" he roars. He stops the boys running around the field and gives them a right rollicking.\n\n*15 minutes later\n\nYou lace up a pair of brand-new trainers that was lent to you by one of Jared's friends. Jared has always been popular but this is ridiculous. It seems what he says just has to be done and everybody never has a bad word to say about him. You would almost go so far as to say Jared's word was law, in a sense. As Jared continues with the rugby game, you leave the pitch feeling sore and a bit narked. When you were in one of the scrums Jared seemed to almost deliberately hurt you. His massive shoulder pounded against yours, and he deliberately moved another player just so he could go opposite you. Should you confront Jared about this or just let it pass?\n", "Confront": "You\u2019re back in the sweaty disgusting and abnormally gross changing room. Showers are present at the back of the room but these are padlocked with black gates. They have never been unlocked and you\u2019re not even sure anybody has a key to those things. As you walk back into the changing room with the other players, you sit on one of the benches and wait for Jared to come in. As Jared dumps his boots underneath the bench and turns around to hang up his outer coat on the hook above, you move towards him and tap him on his massive shoulder. He spins around quickly and looks relieved when he finds out it is only you. \"Ah how you doing buddy, you enjoy the game?\" he says calmly. \"Funny you should mention that because I want to know what is up with you! you have been acting weird lately and you deliberately tried to hurt me in that game.\" you reply aggressively. \"Well you see I was going to do this later but as you decided to push your luck little man, I think its time we taught you a lesson\".\n\nYou didn't notice this before but everybody in the changing room has been sneakily keeping a eye on you since you entered the changing room, and as Jared says this he nods his head at the rugby player behind you and he gets up from the bench and grabs your arms and puts them behind your back. Jared then proceeds to punch you over and over in the stomach, until your lungs feel empty and you feel seriously ill. Then one of the other rugby players produces a jar and you see a slimy purple insect like creature. Its entire body has small projectile like cilia, which move rapidly from side to side, like tiny hairs moving in the wind. You can't see any eyes or ears but imagine it makes up for this with its extreme sense of touch. Horrified the rugby player unscrews the jar and attempts to grab the slimy insect like creature. With one last nod from Jared, the rugby player moves the creature towards your nose, and to your horror; it crawls rapidly up your nose, avoiding the boogies and other obstacles by turning into an almost liquid substance. You are struggling madly, your arms moving erratically and your legs almost on a mind of there own. Holding you down and muffling your screams are the other rugby players, while Jared laughs evilly supervising the situation. This is a very painful experience but it is eventually over.\n", "The infestation": "You wake up groggily and open your eyes. You realise that your in what looks like a underground bunker. The walls are made of metallic metal but despite this the small room is brightly lit. Your sat on a comfortable chair in the middle of the small room. Jared is dozing off in the corner of the room and looks incredibly bored.\n\nYou see Jared jump up from his chair and pat you on the shoulder. \"Glad your awake now, hey BA4627 if your there the speech is about to start, you had better be there if you can the great A4 has arrived!\" He then runs out of the small room and proceeds to close the door with a snap. BA4627? A4?  what the hell was all that about? Some sort of code to get me out of here?\n", "BA4627 ?": "*Bingo! I found the communications section, thank god for that, I was in the hearing section for a while way too noisy*\n\nWhat? Who said that? Show yourself.\n\n*Blah blah blah haven't you worked it out already? , Still it always takes a while*\n\nWhat?!\n\n \n", "Stand up and open the door": "You decide to try to get a closer look at the person talking but as nobody is in the room they must be outside, so you move towards the door. Except you can't. You try with all your might to stand up but you can't. Your legs won't even move let alone opening the door. You then decide to look around the room for something to lean on. But to your horror you can't even move your head.\n\n*30 minutes later\n\nYou have almost given up. You have tried to move every muscle in your body but nothing will budge. The only thing capable of moving is your eyes. But even that is limited. You can't blink. You can't wiggle your toes. You can't bend your elbow. You can't extend your arm. I'm sure you get the idea. You are essentially immobilised. At least you can't hear that voice again though.\n\n*You are in my control earthling and you will soon discover how inhuman your world has become*\n\n \n", "You begin to move": "Your body moves of its own accord, controlled by the creature inside you. When your head turns it\u2019s the creature. When you walk it\u2019s the creature. Every action your body does is being controlled like a puppeteer controlling a puppet. You cant scream or cry or anything because the creature won't let you.\n\nYou eventually zone back into reality and try to figure out where you are. Your in a some kind of meeting room. A rectangular wooden table is in the centre of the room and coffee mugs line the outside. About eight comfortable leather chairs are situated around the table each containing humans. At the end of the table is what looks like a fourteen-year-old boy. He is wearing black sunglasses and appears entirely relaxed.\n\nIn the other chairs are apparently unrelated people who wouldn't normally mix in society. A Doctor, a tough looking man from military intelligence section 5, your local headmaster, sky news official, a politician, and unbelievably a person from the specialist operation branch metropolitan police service, a homeless person and Jared. They are in the middle of a discussion when you walk into the room.\n\n\"A9 what\u2019s the situation with the NHS? What percentage of the workforce have you got under your control?\" The 14-year-old asks.\n\n\"82% we are making good progress sir, we have managed to infiltrate the nurses and have gained full control over the doctors and social receptionists.\" The middle aged doctor replies.\n\n\"Good, good. What about you C3?\"\n\n\"We have almost all the editors and about half the reporters who actually arrive on scene sir.\" The sky news official confidently mentions.\n\n\"B12?\"\n\n\"Well, we are having a bit of trouble A4, the MI5 agents always move in teams and they know something\u2019s up. They think Russia is have infiltrated the company but we have managed to keep our existence secret. We have lost a couple of our insectizilla's in the process but A9 has managed to silence anybody that they have sent to the hospitals that aren't our people.\" The MI5 official has beads of sweat on his face and his jaw tenses nervously as he says this.\n\nThe 14-year-old who is apparently called A4 glares at the MI5 official and asks in a very serious tone. \"Bring me your subordinate, NOW!\" As he barks the last word he thumps his hand on the table. Everybody tenses up and avoids all eye contact with the teenager. The MI5 official called B12 whips out his iphone and quickly dials a number. \"Get in here now, no it can't be avoided. I don't care if it\u2019s your host\u2019s birthday we need you now. Would you prefer if I hand the phone over to A4? \" As he mentions A4 the person on the other end of the phone decides to stop arguing and B12 puts the phone down. \"It is done A4, he is on his way\"\n\nA4, careful not to misplace his spiked gelled hair then nods at a armed man in a suit who is standing in the corner of the room. The armed man immediately pulls out a pistol and fires it at the MI5 official. B12 as he is called slumps over the table instantly and blood fly\u2019s everywhere. The bullet has gone through the bottom of the skull and exited out the top. The bullet lodges itself in the metallic walls and stays there. An insectizilla crawls down the nostril of the man and proceeds to move blindly on the table. A4 calmly impales the creature with his pen, which is in his hand.\n\n\n\"I assume C3 that this mans death will not reach the media?\" The teenager waves his hand around the scene whilst looking at the sky news reporter.\n\n\"No A4 most definitely not\" he replies\n\n\"Anyway, moving on. C7 and C8 what\u2019s going on with that university?\" A4 calmly asks in his adolescent voice.\n\n\"The teachers have been taken and I have given C7 some power as a prefect\" The headmaster replies.\n\n\"C8 is correct and I have begun infestation on the rugby team. The team has allowed me to physically manhandle students into bathrooms or small-unoccupied areas and perform further infestations. In fact here is a low ranking insectizilla in a newly acquired host right now. I proudly announce BA4627\" Jared points at you smiles.\n\n\"Right good, yup whatever, Jared he is your property and your subordinate. I have to infiltrate my newly acquired host's parents, so lets wrap this up. My host's parents are so easily foiled by their genetically related child it shouldn't take long. I am so glad I transferred out of that 81 year-old into a nice new young and energetic teenager. Next meeting is in a week\u2019s time. Inform the new MI5 guy of the duties I expect him to do.\"\n\n You have several options:\n\nIf you have resisted infestation before and have gained a name for yourself you can:\n\nYou can try to convince A4 not to infest his parents but he may not listen\n\nIf you have communicated with the creature inside you , you can:\n\nTry to persuade your insectizilla that's in your head controlling you to have a break and go feed.\n\nFor those players who haven't done either of the above you just going to have to let the insectizilla make that choice for you I'm afraid.\n\n \n", "You have no choice": "The insectizilla controlling you leads you back to the flat. You are with Jared. You now understand why Jared has been so weird all of a sudden. It\u2019s because of the insectizilla inside his head. With a insectizilla inside your head as well you begin to act strange. Like whenever Jack asks a question that requires us to remember something, the insectizilla inside our brain has to dig down into our memory and find the information. But it doesn't take long, only a couple of seconds or so. But you beg silently in your head that Jack will notice and run away. Leave this town and never come back. But he doesn\u2019t.\n\nOne night you and Jared come into his room and pin him down while he is asleep. He wakes up but he is much weaker than Jared let alone me as well. You pin one of his legs down while reaching for a insectizilla in the jar with one of your hands. You then release it under his nose and let the insectizilla do the rest. Jack is one of them. Your insectizilla inside you manages to get promoted to M9. He loses some of his digits and becomes more powerful. He eventually leaves your body and gains a more powerful host. But it doesn't make any difference to you because you are given a new insectizilla, just a lower ranking one. You spend the rest of your days being controlled by the alien species. You eventually become to old to become useful anymore and you are killed.\n"}, "tree": {"The rugby match": {"Confront": {"The infestation": {"BA4627 ?": {"Stand up and open the door": {"You begin to move!": {"Try to convince A4 not to infest his parents": "END"}}, "You have no choice": "END"}}}}}}, {"title": "Mission Sunshine", "stories": {"Intro": "You took a step onto a star below you. It warmed your feet. All around you was space, stars, comets that dashed between the gravities of the lifeless planets in this endless universe. You looked at your palm, pressed it through the air or lack thereof, and with your touch created a ripple in space and time, and you followed it until it fizzled away.\n\nEverything about this boundless world beyond your world mesmerized you, that\u2019s why you studied it. The white dwarf stars whose light was icey, and the small rocks filled with elements not seen on Earth, burning up as they collided with those stars.\n\nYou heard something behind you. It sounded like the whining of a frayed electrical wire. You looked to see a golden light like a young star, creeping towards you, in a form similar to your own. It had one armish limb that reached towards you.\n\nYou weren\u2019t afraid.\n", "MISSION SUNSHINE": "Your vivid, lucid dreams were probably the effect of your following a comet that had been growing nearer for weeks, heading directly towards Earth. It was unlike anything you had seen before. While it was certainly not enormous, it was bright enough to hold your attention, as well as your colleagues\u2019.\n\nThey said it was far too small to make it and you assumed as much as well. It would burn out in the atmosphere, and this was the day it was about to make it to Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nYou watched for hours through the Center\u2019s massive telescope, kept a journal about everything you noticed about the comet. There was something strange about it, perhaps the color was off or peculiar, indicating it was made of unearthly materials. And once it hit the atmosphere, it lit up to a golden light, far too bright for you to continue to watch through the telescope.\n\n\u201cComet seven-fifty has entered the atmosphere, you told your assistant, Mickie. \u201cI can\u2019t watch it any longer. It\u2019s too bright.\u201d\n\nRadars indicated the comet was approaching at an alarming speed, and that its mass was remaining consistent. It wasn\u2019t burning up at all.\n\nThen alarms sounded. A voice over the intercom declared that a mass was approaching the Center, and that everyone should immediately move to the lowest level.\n\nSo your fellow scientists dashed, but none of you could move quick enough. At first there was a rumble beneath your feet as whatever was colliding with Earth broke the sound barrier, then after that, the Center began to shake. The windows lit up as bright as day and suddenly you were blinded.\n\nThere was a distant roaring as the ground settled. You and Mickie had been knocked from your feet, looked at each other in shock.\n\nThe Center was suddenly quiet. No one spoke over the intercom and told you what to do next. You quickly stumbled back to your feet, peered through the telescope, but there was nothing to be seen other than the usual, calm night sky.\n\nYou rushed towards the impact zone, even if security was trying to direct everyone in the opposite direction. You pushed past them, called out to the director, \u201cWhat is it? What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhere did it collide?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree miles south of the Center,\u201d she told you.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see it. This isn\u2019t what we thought it was,\u201d you said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to send in the ETSD before I\u2019m allowing any one of you at the site.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ETSD?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t just an asteroid.\u201d\n\nIt was several weeks before the Center returned to normal, and despite your hounding the director, she refused to tell you anything about what collided with Earth, what that golden light was, and why she called the Extra-Terrestrial Security Division to handle it.\n\nYou asked around to see if anyone knew anything about Mission Sunshine, named after its golden comet that left a supposed radioactive crater in its wake. Of course, if the mission already had a name, certainly there was more going on.\n\nYou were the lead scientist at Telenex\u2019s Center for Space Research, so it was puzzling as to why you were not allowed any of this information.\n\nInitially, Director Montgomery dismissed that this was anything more than a rare, pure gold alloy that had crashed into Earth, but gold clearly would have melted upon atmospheric impact.\n\nYou told Mickie your concerns, to which he replied, \u201cWe best not trouble ourselves in ETSD business. Every scientist that has questioned the director has been fired. Probably brain-wiped beforehand too.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at you, but it quickly faded as he realized how much all this bothered you.\n\n\u201cListen, Quinn, we\u2019re in a good place, but a place that is very very fragile. We\u2019re lucky enough Telenex allows us to know the things we know. I know you\u2019re inquisitive, must be the scientist in you, but don\u2019t get yourself in trouble.\u201d\n\nHe was right. But whether or not you\u2019d listen would be up to you.\n", "Agree with Mickie": "\u201cYou\u2019re right, Mickie.\u201d\n\nHe nodded at you, and you both returned to work.\n\n~~~\n\nObtaining access to the ETSD wing would be difficult. Normally, you would ask Director Montgomery to permit your card, but this entire mission was hush-hush.\n\nYou did, however, know Montgomery\u2019s lunch break.\n\nYou were typing nonsense on your telecomputer as she walked by, said, \u201cYou work yourself too hard, Quinn. Take a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would, Director, but I\u2019m on the precipet of discovering coordinates for an earth-type planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating. Well, very well. But don\u2019t injure yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t do, Director.\u201d\n\nShe nodded at you, and as soon as she had left the room, you stood and hurried towards Montgomery\u2019s office.\n\nYour lovely assistant Mickie had been standing right out in the corridor, and you nearly crashed into him in your limited time frame.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, Quinn?\u201d he asked you. He had a stack of papers in hand.\n\n\u201cCoordinates,\u201d you stuttered, and hurried on by him.\n\n\u201cCoordinates,\u201d he repeated after you, then laughed.\n\nYou slowed your pace thereafter to seem less suspicious, thankful Montgomery\u2019s office wasn\u2019t far from your own. Of course, the door was locked.\n\n\u201cQuinn,\u201d called a voice from behind you, which made you nearly leap from your skin.\n\nYou turned. It was Montgomery, who smiled softly at you.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted so badly to be on Mission Seven-Fifty, you could have told me.\u201d\n\nYou took a breath, dropped a hand from the door to her office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Director, but as the lead here it\u2019s unfair that you\u2019re keeping this from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest,\u201d Montgomery replied, \u201cI wanted to be sure it was completely safe before I allowed my best scientist to see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThem?\u201d\n\nMontgomery led you into the ETSD wing. The security bots looked you up and down.\n\nYou had only been here once when you had received your promotion, but they quickly told you that you wouldn\u2019t have to bother with this wing or the ETSD. Extraterrestrial encounters were something from movies. They had only built this wing in the rare case of one. It was the modern twenties, and the world was obsessed with outer space and the prospect of extraterrestrial life. Especially the owner of Telenex, the elusive Wiley Kleckner.\n\nBut a rare case Mission Sunshine had been, because as Montgomery led you up staircases and corridors, all marked in some coded language you had never seen before, revealed to you was a massive glass tank. Fed into the tank were pipes, wires, gauges, as if it was an aquarium for things beyond your world. And indeed it was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to wear these,\u201d Montgomery told you. She pulled two dark goggles from the wall and handed one to you.\n\nYou put them on, and you both continued into a room connected to this massive fish tank, filled not with water, or fish.\n\nBut instead with light. The same golden light you had witnessed in your telescope weeks before, although considerably dimmed due to the goggles.\n\nThree figures made of that golden light stood in the tank. Several scientists and ETSD security bots were either studying these figures, writing, speaking about them, or guarding the door of which you and Montgomery had entered through.\n\nYour heart raced as you studied them with your eyes. They were several feet taller than any human, with humanoid limbs, heads, hands and feet. It was a good thing you were wearing goggles. They were made entirely of blinding golden light, but had no otherwise discerning features within that light.\n\nThese figures looked like the same figure you had been dreaming about. It was surreal. Your heart slowed in your chest with a severe case of deja-vu.\n\n\u201cThese are Mission Sunshine, Doctor Quinn,\u201d Montgomery told you. \u201cMade entirely of lightwaves so bright they blinded the first scientists that saw them.\u201d\n\nYou stepped towards the glass, reached and touched it. One of the figures noticed you, stepped towards you and increased in height and color. It made a sound like electricity snapping through the air, but constant, and loud.\n\nYou gasped and stepped back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve named them Lightoids. They\u2019re hostile,\u201d Montgomery told you. \u201cThey destroyed a dozen bots before we were able to contain them. One touch and the bots were vaporized, nothing but ash and atoms left where they had been standing. They are extremely dangerous. Can you see why I didn\u2019t want you here before they were contained?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d you told her. \u201cThese Lightoids, they\u2019re fascinating. Unlike anything we\u2019ve seen here or otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t just a comet, Director. Thank you for showing me. I look forward to studying them.\u201d\n\nMontgomery nodded at you. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on Mission Sunshine. I\u2019ll have your card permitted, Doctor. I can\u2019t wait to see what you discover about these creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d\n\n~~~\n\nYour dreams were filled with space, stars and planets, even more now that you discovered what that comet really had been. These Lightoids danced in your dreams, walked across the Milky Way, collected stars of which they fed on. Even in your sleep you felt the warmth of their forms, and the golden light, unseeable with the human eye, was crystal clear in front of you. And the one who lunged at you in the lab, stood still, examining you.\n\nYou reached out like you had before, but instead of lunging, it reached and touched your hand back. And you looked at your hand, and the Lightoid had left a star within your palm.\n\nYou heard your name like it had been said to you through an old telephone. You looked back, and you awakened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on Mission Sunshine,\u201d you told Mickie. \u201cYou will be taking my place here at the Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I said about knowing what we shouldn\u2019t be knowing, but, well, you can drop me some sort of hint, Quinn, can\u2019t you?\u201d he asked with big eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mick, it\u2019s classified. Maybe if you work hard in my position, Montgomery will let you work on the mission too.\u201d\n\nMickie sighed, turned in his chair. \u201cAlright, alright. What were those coordinates you found?\u201d\n\n\u201cTurns out to have been a psuedo-earth-type,\u201d you explained to him. \u201cBy the time we could get there, it will be consumed by its star.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat, now I\u2019ve got to make my own discoveries instead of just stealing yours,\u201d Mickie teased. \u201cGood luck, Quinn. I\u2019ll be on Mission Sunshine by the time you can say psuedo-earth-type.\u201d\n\nYou smiled.\n", "Continue": "You noticed the Lightoids were anxious. And so would you be, locked in a tank on a world you did not know or understand. Whenever a scientist did approach, they would hiss and intimidate him. Some of the scientists were wary and refused to approach the Lightoids, others laughed at these creatures locked behind the glass wall.\n\nYou took a gentler approach. Clearly these Lightoids were of some intelligence. After all, they managed to travel all this way to Earth, from a world probably not even observable from your own. You knew the chances of intelligent life within even millions of lightyears was less than one-percent, so these Lightoids were a once-in-a-lifetime, hells, a once-in-a-universe\u2019s-lifetime opportunity.\n\nOf course, the critical, scientific part of you desired to know from where they travelled, from what they were made, what they were made of, and in what way did this break all the laws of universe you had known until then.\n\nThe other side of you, the emotional side of you, desired to know if you could communicate with them. Humans could communicate with other mammals. It was seemingly instinctual. You wondered if there was a connection between you and the Lightoids simply because you both were alive.\n\nAnd the third part of you, the animal side of you, was just as fearful of these beings as they probably were of you. Who was the hunter and who was the hunted.\n\nYou spent long days in the lab, watching through your dark goggles these beings, how they interacted with one-another. You wondered what their electrical screeches meant.\n\nThere were three of them. One taller than the other two. The taller one paced, or perhaps stalked, back and forth, on long limbs that not so much stepped upon, but floated above the concrete floor. The other was mostly still, hardly moved throughout the days. And the third one was confused, sad, and walked between the other two, perhaps inquiring as to where it was and why it was there. Why they were trapped there being observed by small hairy creatures who wore big glass eyes over their eyes.\n\nThe researchers treated them like animals.\n\nYou stayed into the early hours of the night when everyone had gone away. It was just you and these three Lightoids. You wondered what they called themselves. Probably something much less elementary than Lightoids.\n\nThe shorter two you nicknamed Audre and Hattie. The still one being Audrie, the curious one being Hattie. The tallest one you named Konstantine, a name as mighty as he was. Just so they were less animalistic in your mind.\n\nKonstantine was finally still. He tucked himself tightly into the far corner of the glass tank. And so was Audre, per usual.\n\nBut Hattie looked around, or at least you think she did. You stepped towards the glass. Your eyes were tired but through your mind ran a million thoughts. Your hands wrote scribbled words you would not be able to discern later.\n\nHattie looked at you, then approached you. You stayed still, anticipating she might attack just like Konstantine did.\n\nBut she raised an arm to match your own. When she touched the glass she sent sparks of light flying in every direction.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d you said.\n\nHattie didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Quinn. Marissa Quinn. I am human and you are on Earth.\u201d\n\nFinally, Hattie spoke, but just like Konstantine, her words were nothing more than electrical whining. But unlike Konstantine, her speaking was noticeably softer and quieter.\n\nYou smiled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt you. At least I don\u2019t. But you can\u2019t understand me. And I can\u2019t understand you. We\u2019ll have to fix that.\u201d\n\nHattie\u2019s speaking must have awoken Konstantine. He leapt from his slumber and screeched at you, tore Hattie away from the glass. You tried your best not to flinch and your heart skipped in your chest.\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d you said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a feisty one. I can\u2019t blame you. They have you locked away in here. They tease you. . . I want to help.\u201d\n\nYour hand hadn\u2019t left the glass when Konstantine touched it. In a fit of presumed frustration he sent an electrical charge through the glass, shocked and burned your hand.\n\nYou shouted and pulled away. The light had burned cleanly through your glove, leaving a mark where the charge ran through your veins.\n\n~~~\n\n\u201cYou look rough, Quinn,\u201d Mickie informed you at the cafeteria, making you absently adjust the new glove on your newly burned hand.\n\nYou winced as the fabric rubbed against your skin.\n\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019ve been working nonstop on this. I wish I could tell you, Mickie. You wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me excited just to let me down, Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s nice, being entrusted with an important mission and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd being the most intelligent of all?\u201d\n\nMickie laughed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, that too.\u201d\n\n~~~\n\nThe days passed by far too quickly for your liking. There was too much to learn about essentially an entirely new type of lifeform. Your decade of schooling would have never prepared you for the likes of Lightoids.\n\nYou kept a journal and wrote everything you thought of, noticed, hypothesized about regarding the Lightoids. You looked at the marks Konstantine had left on your hand. The way they moved through space was exactly like electricity, but they looked like golden figures.\n\nYou wondered if the Lightoids were scientific at all. Perhaps they were beyond your world, signs from Gods. But that assumption was difficult to swallow for you. You saw them with your own eyes, unlike any act of Gods.\n", "Disagree with Mickie": "\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mickie. It\u2019s our job to know. I don\u2019t think Telenex has a right to what should be public knowledge. Or at least my knowledge.\u201d\n\nMickie\u2019s face softened at you, but he didn\u2019t say anything. You both returned to work.\n\n~~~\n\nObtaining access to the ETSD wing would be difficult. Normally, you would ask Director Montgomery to permit your card, but this entire mission was hush-hush.\n\nYou did, however, know Montgomery\u2019s lunch break.\n\nYou were typing nonsense on your telecomputer as she walked by, said, \u201cYou work yourself too hard, Quinn. Take a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would, Director, but I\u2019m on the precipet of discovering coordinates for an earth-type planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating. Well, very well. But don\u2019t injure yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t do, Director.\u201d\n\nShe nodded at you, and as soon as she had left the room, you stood and hurried towards Montgomery\u2019s office.\n\nYour lovely assistant Mickie had been standing right out in the corridor, and you nearly crashed into him in your limited time frame.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, Quinn?\u201d he asked you. He had a stack of papers in hand.\n\n\u201cCoordinates,\u201d you stuttered, and hurried on by him.\n\n\u201cCoordinates,\u201d he repeated after you, then laughed.\n\nYou slowed your pace thereafter to seem less suspicious, thankful Montgomery\u2019s office wasn\u2019t far from your own. Of course, the door was locked.\n\n\u201cQuinn,\u201d called a voice from behind you, which made you nearly leap from your skin.\n\nYou turned. It was Montgomery, who smiled softly at you.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted so badly to be on Mission Seven-Fifty, you could have told me.\u201d\n\nYou took a breath, dropped a hand from the door to her office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Director, but as the lead here it\u2019s unfair that you\u2019re keeping this from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest,\u201d Montgomery replied, \u201cI wanted to be sure it was completely safe before I allowed my best scientist to see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThem?\u201d\n\nMontgomery led you into the ETSD wing. The security bots looked you up and down.\n\nYou had only been here once when you had received your promotion, but they quickly told you that you wouldn\u2019t have to bother with this wing or the ETSD. Extraterrestrial encounters were something from movies. They had only built this wing in the rare case of one. It was the modern twenties, and the world was obsessed with outer space and the prospect of extraterrestrial life.

The heat wouldn't be so bad if the planet wasn't also a jungle nightmare teaming with poisonous flora and dangerous fauna.\n\nThe \"primitive\" natives aren't exactly friendly either. Your team medic had to find that out the hard way. Oh sure sometimes you'll come across a tribe that's friendly, but most of the time the lizards see you as food. Soft, fleshy pink food that's invading their territory. Which means you usually end up having to torch an entire village.\n\nFuckin' waste of ammo.\n\nOf course if the planet and its inhabitants weren't enough, there's always the other major powers laying claim to the planet. The Krik Collective, the Mazatt Dominion, and the Elojin Alliance have all laid claims to plunder whatever riches this planet may have and that's why you're here: To make sure this planet is plundered by the Terran Empire instead.\n\nThe next Empire supply ship won't be here for a long time, let alone anymore troops. You're on your own. Ah the joys of being part of the Empire's expeditionary force.\n\nYou and your team have currently set up base in one of those \"friendly\" lizard villages.\n\nWell its a brand new day in Paradise, what's first on the agenda?\n", "Check on your team's activities": "Well you guess you\u2019d better check on your team. Not doing so would certainly look irresponsible of you, hardly becoming of an officer of the Empire.\n\nYou step out of your tent and peruse your team, who are all going about their duties as they should. They\u2019re a good team, sure sometimes they complain, but on this planet its very understandable.\n\nYour Indoctrinator is busily going about his usual brainwashing fanaticism as he tries to instill the values of the Empire to the reptilian natives that live in this village. Salo\u2019s ranting and raving like a mad man as he is apt to do when preaching. The Lizards look at him with a blank expression in a vain attempt to understand what the hell he\u2019s talking about, but you can tell they\u2019re getting agitated.\n\nMeanwhile your inept second in command Lieutenant LaFleur is pointlessly scolding some of the other team members for not setting up their tents by regulation standard. They look annoyed. You swear you think he\u2019s probably come closer to death by his own team members than by any enemy involvement you\u2019d ever engaged in.\n\nWell you should probably intervene somewhere before someone gets killed.\n", "Approach your Indoctrinator": "That overzealous fool is going to turn the entire village against you, and that\u2019s the last thing you need right now. You stop Salo before the Lizards make dinner out of him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?! It\u2019s my job to teach these savages the ways of the Empire, and bring them into the fold, even if they aren\u2019t worthy enough to serve HIM.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not gonna do that by antagonizing the poor scaly bastards! Just leave them alone, its not like we\u2019re leaving anytime soon, and we\u2019ll have a lot easier time of it, if we aren\u2019t fighting every last lizard on this fuckin\u2019 planet!\u201d\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t accept the ways of the Empire, then they deserve to be purged by it!\u201d Salo says predictably.\n\u201cYeah, well if you haven\u2019t noticed we\u2019re a LONG way from the Empire, new supplies won\u2019t be here for months and I\u2019d like to currently supply of ammo to last until then. That won\u2019t happen if we\u2019re blowing away every lizard we come across. Its easier to just work with them when they aren\u2019t actively hostile.\u201d\n\nSalo looks unconvinced and disturbed by your words.\n\u201cAs an Indoctrinator of the Empire it\u2019s also up to me to make sure its servants are not falling astray to alien influences! And you my dear Captain have been displaying suspect behavior as of late! I hope for your sake you haven\u2019t forgotten the values of the Empire!\u201d\nSalo warns and storms off to his tent.\n\nAs the Lizards disperse and go back to their simple village life, you also return to your tent, shaking your head, and thinking about what a short sighted, narrow minded idiot Salo is. You go back to studying the maps of the territory you\u2019ve explored so far and pondering where you should go next, soon one of your men comes in to tell you that the Sergeant has come back from a recon mission and she looks like she\u2019s faced some hostiles. He also tells you they\u2019ve captured an interesting prisoner, an Elojin.\n", "Approach your Lieutenant": "You go over to LaFleur to tell him to lay off with the \u201cby the book\u201d shit. You\u2019d think by now he\u2019d know what looks good on paper doesn\u2019t work in the field.\n\nUnfortunately, while LaFleur was only causing a minor annoyance, Salo was inciting a riot. With his rants he angered the previously peaceful Lizards to the point of hostility. As you\u2019re telling LaFleur to stop being so uptight, a spear goes flying into your back.\n", "Would you like to know more? (Indoctrinator Salo)": "Indoctrinator Salo\u2026\n\nSalo is an Empire Indoctrinator: Loyal, dedicated, intolerant, and utterly fanatical. It\u2019s his job to make sure humanity doesn\u2019t fall to alien influences and to shove humanity\u2019s influences down aliens\u2019 throats or failing that, to annihilate aliens that insist on holding on to their own cultures and humans that question the Empire.\n\nSalo like most of his kind, sees heresy everywhere, he\u2019s even accused you of being too \u201csoft\u201d on the natives on several occasions. What he fails to understand (Or refuses to) is you\u2019re NOT an assault force, you\u2019re scouts. Sometimes in order to survive, you have to work with the population that may live on the planets you\u2019re exploring. In fact, it\u2019s usually easier that way, since you aren\u2019t fighting a battle every five minutes. (Let the marines worry about that when they invade) Indoctrinators though are known for their inflexibility, and Salo has been bending far too much for his taste. He doesn\u2019t even really like the idea of assimilating alien cultures; he\u2019d rather just exterminate them. So far the general hostility of the Lizards has been appeasing his xenophobia. He gets a perverse kick out of chanting Empire doctrine as he\u2019s killing them. You\u2019ve had to stop him a few times from going overboard. While killing native populations is fun for him, he always hopes to meet one of the sworn enemies of the Empire though, he particularly hates Elojin.\n\nYou and Salo have never really gotten along, but you\u2019re getting the impression that you and he are going to really have it out soon and the outcome probably won\u2019t be good. You don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t just ask to be assigned to an Empire Assault Legion instead, he\u2019d still be serving the same purpose of \u201cmoral officer\u201d and he\u2019d be able to kill all the aliens he wanted on a regular basis.\n\nKnowing your luck though, he specifically asked to be assigned to you personally just because the nature of the universe seems to like fucking with you.\n", "Would you like to know more? (Lieutenant LaFleur)": "Lieutenant LaFleur\u2026\n\nIf there was anyone who wants to be here less than you, it\u2019s Lieutenant LaFleur. He doesn\u2019t really even want to be serving in the military at all. The only reason why he joined was due to the fact he comes from a military family and it was pretty much tradition that he HAD to join.\n\nYou\u2019ve come across these types several times before, and they usually fall into two categories; spoiled and not spoiled. The spoiled military brats usually get their high ranking fathers to get them a desk job away from any real fighting of any sort and thus keeping the tradition alive in their family of being an \u201cArmchair General\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately for LaFleur, he came from the unspoiled kind. His father purposely made things even rougher, since he expected more out of him. LaFleur is just not cut out for combat activity though, despite doing well in the classroom. Sensing this flaw, his father was determined to make him worthy of the LaFleur name by assigning him to a scout force. He would either learn how to adapt or die. Either one would be considered honorable to the family name.\n\nWhile LaFleur can memorize rules and regulation and perform administration with the best of them, he\u2019s absolutely pitiful out on the field. He hasn\u2019t actually run away yet, but he\u2019s come close. Only Salo\u2019s constant rants of how he\u2019ll personally capture and torture anyone who runs away in battle are probably what keep him around. As it is, he mostly hangs in the back and fires a shot every once in a while.\n\nYou would almost feel sorry for him, if he wasn\u2019t so annoying.\n", "Stay in your quarters": "Avoiding your problems won\u2019t solve anything and it certainly doesn\u2019t solve anything here.\n\nYou fall asleep, and you don\u2019t check on your team and they get into trouble without you looking over them. So it shouldn\u2019t be all that much of a shock when a Lizard spear to your stomach wakes you up.\n", "Would you like to know more? (Your story)": "The Empire and You.\n\nSure sounded like a good idea at the time when you first saw those commercials and heard all the propaganda about how humanity needed you most. You pretty much bought it hook line and sinker, just like they planned.\n\nWere you REALLY that bored on your backwater planet?\n\nWell yeah you were actually. You were raised on a relatively unsettled world, barely colonized, just a few farming communities basically. Your world wasn\u2019t dangerous at all; the Empire had long since exterminated a native species living on it before humans came to settle it. Yep, nice and orderly.\n\nYou always felt stuck on your insignificant planet, you felt like you should be doing something greater, something more important. When the recruiters came you saw it as a way out of the intergalactic boonies and joined up right away. No longer would you be some drone, you\u2019d be making a difference for humanity and gaining all the accolades that go with it. Since then you\u2019re almost regretting that decision.\n\nIt\u2019s not really the danger that bothers you, or the suicide like missions they give you. It\u2019s the mood of still feeling insignificant. You thought this would all be different somehow. You thought you\u2019d have a command of legions of troops, bringing glory to the Empire, and conquering worlds in HIS name.\n\nAs it is, you\u2019re a glorified scout, because the Empire decided your skills would be better put to use there and of course the Empire is ALWAYS right.\n\nSure there\u2019s adventure, but no fame, no adoration, there\u2019s barely any acknowledgement for what you do, despite the fact that you\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it and reached the rank of Captain. But if you were to get killed, you\u2019d be replaced easy enough. The average grunt is probably more valued, you\u2019re a canary in the coal mine.\n\nSometimes you think there\u2019s gotta be a way out of this mess you\u2019ve gotten yourself into\u2026\n"}, "tree": {"The First Page": {"Check on your team's activities": {"Approach your Indoctrinator": "END", "Approach your Lieutenant": "END", "Would you like to know more?

The light of the three moons shines for the last time before dawn; the time of the weekly ritual is approaching. After that, the orchestra and the choir start to play the ancient song in a slow and monotonous endless loop\n\nAmazing Grace, How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost, but now am found\n\nT'was blind but now I see\nT'was Grace that taught my heart to fear And Grace, my fears relieved How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed.\n\n[i]Through many dangers, toils and snares We have already come.\n\nThe coffin's procession commences, floating with its anti-gravitational fields, while citizens watch the show bored. Every week, the same spectacle has been happening since the dawn of times; most of the citizens simply navigate the holo-net, making sure that their own Karma credits aren't dropping.\n\nA dreary voice whispers at you, but you are unable to find out the source: the stasis coffin speaker. You can finally hear it, a distant male voice: \"Your previous self has died. However, you are an important party in the ritual; your inert body is sleeping in one of the communal caskets. Your memory begins to disintegrate. Soon, The primordial energy of the Fire's tower will return your body two ashes, blood, dust, and bones. A new you with your same DNA would respawn as it has happened to you through thousands of reincarnation cycle.\"\n\nThe voice stops and you look at the coffin waiting for it continues. Have you understood?\" The weird voice sounds bored.\n\nYou ponder about who is talking with you. \"Is this a dream?\"\n\n\"I have already explained it to you; I have another thousand to guide on my shift. You have to think about who you were in your previous life, everything will be fine.\"\n", "I was a petty criminal, typically selling hallucinogens drugs to children.": "\"Without a doubt, it is a respectable job.\" The irony of the voice does not escape you. \"But where you are going, it will not make you lose sleep.\"\n", "Memories of a lost life": "You do not know why, but thinking about the few pieces of your old life make you feel better and step by step, you glide with the other hundreds of dead to the point of respawning surrounded by the rest of the city.\n\nWhat was my name? you ask yourself. Your mind is numb; you should remember it... But, absolutely nothing else comes to your mind.\n\nOne by one all the coffins are entering the nucleus of the Respawn's square. It is a circle of blue energy illuminated by the holographic flames of the immense Tower of fire. Your turn comes and immense drowsiness invades you.\n\nTotal darkness, I don't even have a body or something that serves as an anchor. I shouldn't be here, Someone is watching me, lurking in the pitch-black shadows.\n\nSuddenly you hear strange noise, two voices almost as if they come from a speaker inside you.\n\n\"Are you sure that you have cleared the cache memory of today's avatars? Since the last major update, the deletion of data files is working weirdly.\" The voice mumbles clearly stressed by the situation.\n\n\nAnother voice slowly responds which it seems to come from a drugged woman: \"Relax, dude. They will give us the credits, anyway. Nothing has ever happened in centuries, not that anything bad can happen nowadays.\"\n\nThe man responds more lively almost euphoric: \"You're right, after this respawn, what if we go to the back of your pick up?\"\n\nTheir suggestive giggles and heated moans are the last things you can understand before a tunnel of bright light engulfs you in bones and marrow.\n\nYou are becoming a skeleton. There is no doubt about it, you are once more in the huge row of people being reproduced and redone bone to bone, marrow to marrow. It is a painfully slow process each organ assembled by this mysterious energy until each and everyone in the line has the body of a baby.\n", "\"Hey, can any of you hear me?\"": "That's what you want to say but only waa, gaa and other baby noises come out of your mouth. Even things as simple to pronounce as a mom, or potato; They become simple baby noises, gibberish.\n", "Nursery here I go!": "Finally, you surrender to the evidence, as in every cycle of life on your planet, when you die you are reborn with the same DNA but in a new life.\nPeople never remember previous lives. You remember reading it in books. But not where you lived, you don't even know your old name. Something went wrong in your respawn. you sigh while little by little, the row of now plump babies begins to teleport all of you through that blinding white light.\n\nYour life has become a hell, filled with wet baby diapers and the eternal presence of bellowing balls of vomit and farts. The simple fact of being there, lying in one of the hundreds of robotic cribs of the state nursery drives you mad.\n\nLife as a baby is torture itself, you want to move, scratch yourself or just sit. But you can not. Even worse, all your reactions are being computerized and recorded and use to evaluate in which social group and to which work you will be destined your future adult life.\n\nAt least, that is what they taught you in your other life. But the glitch that allows you to remember also allows you to see beyond visible, sometimes [ people do things without them being aware of it. At first, you thought that you were crazy, but now you have no doubt that is true; some kind of creatures mentally controls the rest of the population I ordering them to do stuff.\n\nYou can see how the nearest nurse comes up with strange icons and wishes.\n\nI think if I concentrate, I can understand them. Although, I can concentrate on trying to make my baby's body grow stronger. This baby body has very little stamina so I won't have the strength to do both.\n", "Read her mind and her wishes": "As a baby, it is very difficult to focus your sight on something else for a long time. However, you concentrate on it, imagining that you are an entity, floating in the third person as in a video game. After that, something just clicks on your mind. You see clearly a pop-up read mind command floating over the plump redhead nurse. Then you summon your mind power as a mental big hand that presses the icon. The pressure on your tender infant skull is almost unbearable as the body begins to cry as a defence mechanism, without you being able to do anything to avoid it. But her mind opened to you like a flower\n\nSandra is so pretty and she just broke up with Alison, if I only dared to tell her something. Now, I have to put this drug away for the black market, it's too valuable to spoil the booster treatment in middle-class kids. The connection with her memories and desires is finally broken, leaving you deadly exhausted.\n\nMartha is so distracted by her steamy thoughts, that she is bottle-feeding you too fast, almost about to suffocate you in artificial milk. You are exhausted, but still, you can sense how your mind's power expands. Maybe tomorrow, you can do something about Martha.\n", "You will try to increase your control over the nurse's mind.": "The environment of the infant's area is supposedly sweet and calm during the 2 months in which citizens do not know how to walk and talk. But that is not true, in whatever direction you can precariously lift your head to peek, you can always see at least one baby crying at all hours. Nothing to do except stupid exercises of interactive lights for babies.\n\nYou concentrate your mind on reading the adults' minds in the room, this practice has been your lifesaver, keeping you sane this last two weeks.\n\nMartha is totally obsessed with Sandra, to the point that it could be dangerous. You can see her turbulent thoughts spinning out of control in her mind, making her paranoid and unbalanced.\n\nYou feel at the edge of your consciousness the power to change it, shape it, not only her but the other nurses as well.\n\nYou still don't have the power to control them, but the principle of that ability lies within you.\n\nWill I use it? That is the question I must ask myself. And if I do it, How? The most logical thing is to do it, then in the future, I can decide to use my power or not. But, I need that option to have an advantage.\n\nDay after day, you nurture your power trying to get a better hold over the nearby adult minds. Children minds around you; they are quite different from the adults, a turbulent whirlpool of neurons trying to connect with themselves and with their five senses. There is not consciousness yet, only endless possibilities.\n", "You will focus on the boost and how to get it": "There is nothing you can do in this daycare prison. You can't walk, talk or do anything, but eat, sleep and cry. Your mind flies free outside your crib, contacting with the adult minds nearby. The children's minds around are quite different from the adults, more like a turbulent whirlpool of neurons, trying to connect between themselves and with your senses. There is not consciousness, yet, so You can't really affect them.\n\nHowever, you can affect adults to your advantage to gain a physical advantage of your new mental power. In your previous life, you have heard of drugs that induce strength or agility which contain nanites capable of accelerating the body permanently if they are injected into children in early stages. The middle class seldom gets them, so getting that product, even one weak, will be a competitive advantage.\n\nAnd I'm going to get it, whatever it takes.\n\nDay after day, you gawk the obsessed Martha's mind, trying o get the nano injection. You feel at the edge of your consciousness the power to change her perception and shape it. And one night you know how to do it; you paint in her mind the image of her beloved semi-naked Sandra running to kiss her with a suggestive grin on her cherry-coloured lips. Her robust face lights up at the totally real vision in her brain, while in trance, you order her to give you the injection.\n\nYour ears are deafened by a horrible beep, your temples vibrate with the pressure. Your skull is unable to sustain such an amount of psychic energy. You release Martha from her trance, as soon as you feel the puncture. Thankfully, she has forgotten everything that happened in the last minute and a half.\n\nYour mind is now a painful pulp, like a squeezed lemon. But you feel how new energy runs through your veins increasing your agility and muscular strength, so at least for now, it was worth it, while you prepare for a well-deserved rest.\n", "Doctors are monitoring you closely.": "Doctors and nurses circle your crib with surprise as they write their mysterious reports in their holo pads. Maybe they are too surprised.\n\nDr Michael, as taciturn as bald, does not stop scratching his scalp full of psoriasis: \"This child's behavioural patterns aren't normal. Look at his statistics are off the table!\"\n\nHis tall companion elegantly wears one of those luxurious costumes that people are only able to buy through lucrative schemes. He looks at you as if he were appraising before finally murmuring between his diamond teeth: \"You will not believe that he is a child with the chosen one syndrome?\"\n\n\"A messiah? I hope not, how many deaths caused the last case a thousand years ago? The doctor simply takes his holo pad in his bony hands and asks in a clear voice\" Rigoberta, How many died in the last main quest DLC? \"\n\nA computerized voice that sounds like a porn actress with bronchitis murmurs dramatically: \"A billion people dead and 24 years of nuclear winter, my old cream-filled little bottle.\"\n\nThe man coughs ashamed, \"Well, hmmm, that. However, it must be acknowledged, that most of the chosen ones are not like the one that bombed Megaton.\"\n\n\"You're right, they can be a saving angel. However, the less messianic people, the more stable society becomes.\"\n", "\"We should put him on The genius class.\"": "Advanced level? That means being part of the thinking and scientific research class. Respected and revered as the magicians of ancient stories. As loved as feared. Without a doubt, it is a great advance compared to my old life in the basic class.\n\n\"Look, he is able to smile and fix his gaze. It seems like he understood what we are saying.\" The suit surprised man says.\n", "Home, sweet home": "A month later, Elementary Genius School. Your personal quarters.\n\nIt is unbelievable, that you have a 90 meters apartment at your disposal with three androids servants. Designed furniture hand made with the best steel and leather a perfect kitchen with an industrial design with an island of endless white marble.\n\nThe change has been a blessing, no more squeaky smelling babies. Still, the greatest blessing of all, it is being able to walk. Now that you are an infant genius and your mouth can finally articulate its first words.\n\nYour own bedroom is bigger than anything you had in your previous life, at least that you think it is. too difficult to remember specific details of your past.\n\nEverything around you has been designed to the smallest detail to try to stimulate the children's brain: musical books, drawing material, science for babies. Even your own holo robot construction kit, a fortune spent on you is just a baby.\n\nHowever, you practically have not seen any living being since your arrival in this beautiful gold cage, neither other children, nor adults. In the middle-class nursery, you were never alone engulfed in the babbling mass of the other newborns; ironically, now it is the silence what is engulfing you.\n\nBut it is not the worst at every moment, you can feel the synthetic eyes of your robotic servants evaluating each of your gestures and with which you play or not every movement and look. You can almost see their positronic brains compute every moment to find out what your social predestination will be.\n\nLike every citizen, you have heard rumours that unsuccessful children are brutally murdered so that they never tell any of the secrets of their social caste. For the first time, locked in your luxurious cell you start to believe in it.\n\nThere is no way on Earth!, I will not let myself being massacred. I have an adult understanding of everything, that none of my classmates has; I will use that fact in my favour, or I will slay anyone in my way.\n", "Trying to gather information from the robots.": "You keep a watch on them while still trying to keep yourself in character imitating the movements and gestures of an infant who recently learned to speak; you do not want to draw the attention of the Center's security, as any feature considered inferior or deviant, can get you killed. Or at least that is what the rumours say.\n\nThese androids, which are made in raw metal and wires, are undoubtedly imposing and macabre, with bright eyes in their smiling skull. It makes you think in the image of the Grim Reaper; probably they have been made this way to emphasize that they are jailers and not friends of the genius child.\n\nAt your disposal, there are various holo pads with interactive books and educational games. Great, that can be your access to the Android's code and get some information about what the hell is going on.\n\nYou take the holo pad and sit in the impressive high-tech desk chair that fits like a glove to your body. You sigh, a stabbing pain begins to settle in your temples as if you had an ember burning inside. It is a really strange sensation that it seems to spread out from inside your left eye.\n", "Focus on scanning what do you have inside the eye.": "You uneasily stare at the false window with that hyperrealistic view of a park. Meanwhile, you holding your head and crying like a child is supposed to do, but none of your nanny skeletons comes to help you.\n\nA chill runs down your back, so far, your jailers have satisfied each and every one of your needs to the smallest detail with robotic precision. And yet, now they ignore all your pleas.\n\nThis can only mean one thing. Someone has given you a drug or inserted something. It has to be some kind of twisted test. They have to know, or at least suspect that there is something different in me.\n\nYou stop complaining, although the pangs of pain in your temples are increasingly intense, almost as if something was devouring you from inside. You grab the holo pad delicately and start browsing the basic menu while something starts to hover around your consciousness. Command menus appear in the air floating above the head of the androids; You clearly perceive them as a pop up of a computer holo.\n"}, "tree": {"I was a petty criminal, typically selling hallucinogens drugs to children.": {"Memories of a lost life": {"\"Hey, can any of you hear me?\"": {"Nursery here I go!": {"Read her mind and her wishes": {"You will try to increase your control over the nurse's mind.": {"Doctors are monitoring you closely.": "END"}}}}, "You will focus on the boost and how to get it": {"Doctors are monitoring you closely.": {"\"We should put him on The genius class.\"": {"Walking at least!": {"Trying to gather information from the Holographic web.": "END", "Stop trying to get the info; it is too risky.": "END"}}, "Trying to gather information from the robots.": {"Focus on scanning what do you have inside the eye.": {"Hijack their scans to check out your eye yourself.": "END", "Order them to electrocute the chip.": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Prometheus Academy", "stories": {"The First Page": "You sit an old chair, staring out the window of a shitty New York foster home.

The Crimson Cape.\n\n\n\"Mia! It's time for dinner!\" a voice calls from the stairwell behind you.\n\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" you reply softly, your gaze shifting.\n\n\n\"Mia, you need to eat,\" Gertrude says, as she appears just at the edge of your vision, carrying a plate.\n\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" you repeat.\n\n\nGertrude sighs, and sets the plate down, before walking off. You listen as the stairs creek as she walks downstairs. You wait until she's gone before leaning over and grabbing the plate to inspect your meal: Fish Fingers and Potato Waffles. You eagerly dig in: you're starving, despite what you said to your newest caretaker. You just don't want to sit at that big oak table as the other kids go through their days, describing boring interactions with friends and telling stories as banal as the discovery of a dead rat outside their school. You can't deal with people right now.\n\n\nYou continue staring out the window for some time. What little light the pale winter sun provides is snuffed out by darkness, and once again Gertrude appears at the top of the stairs.\n\n\n\"Mia, it's time for bed,\" she says, already knowing what the response will be.\n\n\n\"I'm not tired.\"\n\n\n\"Mia, you can't spend the rest of your life sitting in that chair,\" Gertrude says in a soft, pleading voice. \"Can you just go to bed?\"\n", "Agree": "\"Fine,\" you say, clambering out of the chair.\n\n\n\"Oh, really? Fantastic!\" Gertrude says. \"I'll just get your bandages, you brush your teeth.\"\n\n\nYou walk into the bathroom, and grab your toothbrush. You're forced to use your elbows to squeeze out the toothpaste onto the brush, but it only takes about a minute's work. You brush your teeth quickly, before Gertrude arrives again, carrying a small first aid kit. She opens the clasps and takes out a roll of bandages and a scissors. You wait as she snips the bandages wrapped around your head and they fall to the floor. You catch a sickening glimpse of your face in the mirror. A fleshy, bloody cavern where your right eye once was appears, before Gertrude quickly wraps fresh bandages around it, obscuring your view. Gertrude cuts off the bandages wrapped around the burnt stump of your left arm, and quickly replaces the charred flesh with clean, white bandages.\n\n\n\"There!\" Gertrude says with a smile. \"Have you brushed your teeth?\"\n\n\nYou nod, and Gertrude leads you to your bedroom. You share a bedroom with Mona, a girl about your age who's been in the foster home for a few weeks, same as you. Mona is already tucked in her bed, his red, ruddy face looking up at you from under the covers.\n\n\n\"Are you finally sleeping in here rather than your chair, Mia?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"Yes, she is. You can't have this room all to yourself, can you?\" Gertrude smiles.\n\n\nYou collapse onto the bed as Gertrude stands over Mona expectantly.\n\n\n\"What?\" Mona asks innocently.\n\n\n\"Give me your phone, Mona.

A bright light fills your head as you open your eyes. A picture slowly fades into focus, for the first time. You can tell you\u2019re standing up, somehow; it\u2019s just intuitive. You stare straight ahead, taking in your surroundings. There\u2019s a cluttered desk filled with miscellaneous fancy-looking circuitry and a computer, along with three bottles that say 5-Hour Energy\u2122, assorted discarded ramen packages, two light fixtures (one that seems to be missing a bulb), various broken keyboards, and four books. You\u2019re vaguely aware of someone saying the phrase \u201cMr. Roboto\u201d (is that your name?) over and over again, but it hasn\u2019t fully registered. You look down, and the whole perspective shifts. Woah, you think again. You decide to practice this motion: up, down, up, down. You realize that the vertical metal object you see when you look down is part of you. Finally, your silicon brain recognizes the voice. You turn to face the source of the sound, amazing yourself again with the perspective change. The new sight amazes you: a nerdy-looking 24-year old ginger with an odd haircut and freckles is looking at you expectantly. You\u2019re not exactly sure how you know what these things are, but you assume it\u2019s the same way you recognized the ramen packages and books earlier: God willed it to be. There\u2019s really no other explanation.\n\n\n    The voice starts again, and this time you\u2019re able to connect it to the person in front of you.\n\n\n    \u201cMr. Roboto, if you can understand me, say, \u2018Jules,\u2019\u201d the voice instructs.\n\n\nThe sounds soothe you, and you can definitely understand what is being said. Even though you\u2019ve never spoken before, you know what to do. You open your mouth and pronounce \u2018Jules.\u2019 Or at least you try to. Instead, you just let out a nasally \u201chuff\u201d sound. The person (Jules?) frowns.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t get that part quite right\u2026\u201d she admits. \u201cOkay, if you can understand me, move your head up and down like you were doing earlier.\u201d\n\n\nThis instruction is much easier for you, as you\u2019ve done it before. You look up to the ceiling, then down to the floor, then back to the ceiling, then the floor. Ceiling. Floor. Ceiling. Floor.\n\n\n\u201cUh, you can stop now,\u201d Jules says, and you stop moving your head. She has an amused, but nonetheless proud smile on her face.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Roboto, can you raise your arm?\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. Can you? You\u2019ve never tried. You will your arm to move, and sure enough, it does! Jules\u2019s smile widens. It makes you happy that she\u2019s happy. She asks if you can make a fist, if you can raise each finger individually, if you can rub your belly and pat your head at the same time. You discover that, yes, you can do all of those, even if the last one is a bit strange. She hands you a banana and asks you to hold it. She places it in your hand, and you grip it. You can feel that it\u2019s soft, but you don\u2019t squeeze it hard enough to squish it. She tells you to set it down on the desk, which you do, and then she hugs you with excitement. Not knowing exactly what to do, you imitate her, wrapping your arms around her gently. After a couple seconds, she releases her arms, and you follow suit.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so proud of you, Mr. Roboto! You\u2019re perfect!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d\n\n\nYou place one foot in front of the other and amazingly stay balanced. You weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be able to do it.\n\n\n\u201cGreat! Now explore this room.\u201d You walk back over to the desk that you were looking at when you were brought to life, and grab one of the energy drink bottles. It makes some kind of sloshing when you move it around, and you decide to turn it upside down. Some amount of a sticky red liquid comes running out, and Jules gasps.\n\n\n\u201cStop! Stop! I\u2019m sorry, I should have told you not to do that.\u201d She notices your dejected look and adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the end of the world. I can clean it up, no problem. Please don\u2019t do it again though.\u201d You set the bottle down, feeling bad about spilling the liquid.\n\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t feel bad, Mr. Roboto, it\u2019s really not a problem! Besides, it was my fault for not telling you. You didn\u2019t know any better. Okay, this time, you can explore the room, but don\u2019t spill things like that or knock things over or break anything. Got it? Oh, uh, move your head up and down a couple of times if you understand. It\u2019s called \u2018nodding.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nYou nod, and go back to exploring. In front of you is the table, which has a couple of broken light fixtures, various trash, and Jules\u2019s computer. You could investigate more on the table, or explore more of her room. What next?\n", "Darkness": "    The world goes black, and you hear a deep humming noise. This feels weird; you\u2019re not as conscious as before, but you can still process information. You can\u2019t sense or interact with the world around you at all, however. You think back to when you were conscious, your first experience alive. You\u2019re still not entirely sure what happened, or how you got there. You can\u2019t remember anything before you first opened your eyes; it\u2019s as though time started then. Well, it technically did, for you at least.\n\n\n    Soon, you pose the question to yourself: How did you know what you knew earlier? Moving your arms and walking, for example, had come naturally to you, and you could understand what Jules meant when she spoke. You intuitively knew what to try when she asked you to speak, and even though it didn\u2019t work (not your fault), you still made a valiant effort. Additionally, you were able to read the labels of the assorted junk on the desk. You\u2019ve also known you were a robot for literally as long as you can remember. However, you clearly didn\u2019t know everything. The liquid coming out of the energy drink surprised you, and you didn\u2019t know Jules\u2019s name until she suggested it to you. Nor did you know how to nod until it was explained.\n\n\n    Using the same line of thought as earlier, you assume that it must have been the god that made you who instilled these facts in you and linked your metal body with your electronic brain. This concept must have also come from a god, because you\u2019re not sure how else it could have come to be. You haven\u2019t lived long enough to develop your own idea like this. Actually, now that you\u2019re thinking about this, you\u2019re no longer positive that \u2018god\u2019 is the right term. More like \u2018creator.\u2019 Now who could be your creator? The jury\u2019s still out on that one. You suppose it could be Jules, but you don\u2019t know that for sure. It would make sense though, since she said that she didn\u2019t quite get your speaking correct. However, there\u2019s not enough evidence to conclude. You file the question as unanswerable as of now.\n\n\n    Suddenly, you feel a unique sensation in your head. You\u2019ve never felt it before, at least. You intuitively know that it\u2019s more data being added to your brain. Maybe Jules is working on fixing your speech mechanism. You wonder if there\u2019s going to be any hardware modifications, or if she\u2019ll just change the software.\n\n\nThe humming noise that started when you passed out stopped, and you find that you can open your eyes now. Upon doing so, you realize you are lying in a bed face up, which is definitely not the position you were in when you passed out. Jules is holding a USB cable that you figure was just plugged into you, transferring new data. You decide to try to speak.\n\n\n\u201cJules.\u201d Your voice is cold and detached, nothing like Jules\u2019s. It\u2019s not really what you expected either, but at least you can communicate properly now. Jules looks at you with a mixture of shock and pride.\n\n\n\u201cOh, you can talk now! That\u2019s amazing! I\u2019m so happy for you! Oh, by the way, that\u2019s my name. Jules.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, I figured. I\u2019m happy that I can communicate effectively now. I have plenty of questions to ask you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, do you? This will be interesting!\u201d\n\n\n    What question do you decide to ask?\n", "Definition of Humanity": "    \u201cWhat does it mean to be a robot? Are you a robot? How do I know I\u2019m a robot?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWell, the first question is really tough. I\u2019ll come back to it. I am not a robot. Most of the conscious beings on the planet are not robots. Robots have been around for around 150 years, since the 1950s or so, but only within the last ten have they been made to be sentient. By that I mean that the first robots on the planet were just aides for people. There were (and still are) robots that did nothing but fold metal into certain patterns, or drill holes in objects at positions specified by people. Recently, however, breakthroughs in neural networking, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have allowed for the creation of robots that can think for themselves. Essentially, they are humans inside metal bodies. Well, the legal system disagrees with that assessment, but that\u2019s another story. As for how you know you\u2019re a robot, well, I programmed that into you. You\u2019ve also probably noticed some automatic understanding of other things, like language and motor skills, and those were also programmed by me. Does that answer your questions?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWhat should I clarify?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cI do not understand what humans are, either. Your explanation of robots relies on an understanding of this concept. Did you make me? Who are you? If humans made robots, how did the first human come to be?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cDefining humanity is a difficult task. Many philosophers have attempted to do so, and none quite fit my bill. Well actually, let me start with the legal definition, with which I disagree. From the perspective of law enforcement, the government, etc., in order to be human, you must be made of flesh and bones. You must be born from another human, and have genetic material inside of you. You must be alive, whatever that means. However, I disagree with this assessment. I view humanity as a trait that even robots can have. If one is self aware and able to connect with other sentient beings on an empathetic level, that\u2019s good enough for me. At a legal level, sentient robots cannot own property, they cannot sue, murdering them counts as destruction of property rather than murder.\n\n\n\u201cFor your next question, well, I kind of made you. You are made of metal components machined here at Stanford, in their fancy shop. I designed your brain, the circuitry and coding that make you conscious and able to move. I\u2019m really more of a computer engineer, so I enlisted help from my advisor to design and build the rest.\n\n\n\u201cWho am I? That\u2019s another very good question, and one that\u2019s hard to answer. My name is Jules Botten, I\u2019m of Norwegian descent. I was born in the United States, Minnesota specifically. I went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for my undergrad, and I\u2019m currently pursuing a Ph.D here at Stanford. I like to make things, and you\u2019re the first conscious robot I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m not sure what else to say about myself. Regarding who made the first human, well, it\u2019s a subject of intense controversy. Most scientists believe that people evolved from more primitive life forms, all the way back to the very first one. Where that first life form came from is still unknown, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense. Will I ever be able to meet your advisor who designed my physical body?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually, yes, I have a meeting with him at\u2026 oh shit, I had a meeting twenty minutes ago. We\u2019ve got to go now, if you want to meet him.\u201d\n", "Chase": "    You follow Jules out of the apartment, and you\u2019re immediately blown away by how far you can see. You\u2019ve never seen more than a few feet in front of you at any given point for your entire existence, and now you can see for miles! It\u2019s a slightly overcast day, but it\u2019s bright out and mostly cheerful in Palo Alto. Jules tells you to follow her and she starts running. Having never ran before, you\u2019re a bit nervous, but you decide to just go for it. Surprisingly, you\u2019re able to catch up to her quite easily; your fears were unfounded. Running comes naturally to you, somehow. It\u2019s probably programmed in by Jules.\n\n\n    As you progress, you start to notice people looking at you oddly. You look down at yourself, and notice that your metal body does not remotely look like any of the people you see. You tell yourself that they\u2019re probably just not used to your kind being seen outside. After all, Jules did say that you were a fairly recent innovation. Still, you can\u2019t help but wonder if there isn\u2019t more to it. You remember that Jules said something about how you didn\u2019t legally have the same rights as a person, because you were made of metal rather than flesh. Maybe they don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re different.\n\n\n    Before you have any time to ponder it further, you realize that Jules stopped jogging and you have arrived at the destination. Despite being so close, you\u2019re amazed at how different it looks (at least from the outside) from the building you were in previously. Whereas the other was short, yell0w-beige, and extended a long way in either direction, this building was anything but plain: tall, with oddly shaped chromed panels jutting out in what seemed like random directions. This must be the building in which her advisor works. Sure enough, Jules walks inside and proceeds to head towards the elevator. You follow, but move slower; you can\u2019t help but admire all of the fancy machinery around you. And this is just the bottom floor! The people here must be more used to seeing robots out in the open, because they only give you a brief glance before returning to their work, unlike the assortment of people outside. Jules reminds you to hurry up, because she\u2019s in a rush. Right, she\u2019s late to the meeting. You wonder what the advisor will be like.\n\n\n    Once you reach his office, which is right next to a room labeled \u201cMACHINE SHOP\u201d (assumedly your \u201cbirthplace\u201d), Jules knocks gently before entering. You follow her inside, and you see a man with unkempt graying hair, a button down shirt, and a pudgy face. Jules introduces you to him. His name is Sean Nash, and you quickly learn how to shake hands properly. The man seems impressed with you, and begins conversing. He seems very friendly and polite.\n\n\n    \u201cWhat were your first conscious thoughts when you first woke up?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cOne of my first thoughts was how I instantly became aware of my surroundings, as if by magic. I was also thinking about how I knew what I did already. Moreover, I was in awe; seeing things for the first time is an incredible experience.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cDo you have any questions that as of yet, you have not found an answer to?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cI do not understand why many people treat me as though I am inferior to them. I sensed distrust coming from many people in the outside world, and Jules was explaining to me how I am not a legal citizen of this country. From what I know and have learned so far, I am capable of conscious thought, as is everyone in the world. What separates them from me?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cUnfortunately, human beings are not nearly as rational/logical as would be ideal. Often, emotions cloud one\u2019s perspective of the world. Many science fiction writers, even before the first sentient robot was made, wrote \u201ccautionary\u201d (but actually fear mongering) tales of what might happen when robots could think for themselves. Stories such as The Matrix and I, Robot present such points of view, which have surely influenced humanity\u2019s perspective. Also, influential scientists of the early 21st century such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk demanded that research be stopped on AI in order to preserve humanity, though you know how successful that petition was. Additionally, people are more likely to fear things they don\u2019t understand, and unfortunately, the average person does not understand how artificial intelligence works. You may have noticed that you got fewer odd looks from the people in this building, who, for the most part, understand AI, compared to all of the normal people of Palo Alto. Also, considering the large percentage of Palo Altoans who work in the information sciences/engineering fields, the city is very progressive in acceptance of robots compared to, say, Phoenix, Arizona.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cI don\u2019t think I would like it there.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cProbably not. As for where you stand legally, well, it\u2019s kind of a gray area, actually. It hasn\u2019t been defined by the Supreme Court whether or not you count as a citizen because it\u2019s ambiguous whether or not you count as a person, and furthermore, whether or not being created counts as being born. If you are classified as a person and defined to have been born in America, then you are a citizen and must have equal protection under the law.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cIs there any hope for my personhood to be confirmed by the state given the negative impressions many have of me?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWhile it is an uphill battle, in short, yes. The Supreme Court decides these sorts of things, and they are not directly influenced by the will of the people. In Citizens United v. FEC, for example, the Supreme Court defined that \u201cperson\u201d can mean \u201ccorporation\u201d and that corporations have unlimited free speech as granted by the 1st Amendment. Given that we have 5 left-leaning Justices and 4 right-leaning, it should be theoretically possible for a case that makes it to the Supreme Court to be ruled in your favor.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cI think I understand. Thank you Professor Nash.\u201d\n\n\n    Before you left, Professor Nash complemented Jules on building such a smart and tenacious AI, to which Jules blushed and thanked the professor. You take the compliments in stride, though they boost your ego at least a tiny bit.\n\n\n    As soon as you left the office, you ask Jules what it takes to get a case to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n    \u201cOh wow, you\u2019re really serious about this, aren\u2019t you? Well, getting a case to the SCOTUS is pretty difficult, admittedly. If you challenge someone in a lower court and lose, you can appeal the case. There\u2019s a hierarchy of courts, the highest of which is the Supreme Court. You need to appeal your way up the ladder, basically. And even then, the Court doesn\u2019t have to take your case. They can\u2019t take every case that gets to them, so they pick and choose the most important ones to rule on. However, if your case made it that high, I\u2019m sure you would be selected, due to the large impact that giving citizenship to sentient robots would have.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cHow would I get a case that allows me to challenge someone in a lower court?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cYou can sue the government for your citizenship. That would probably be the best way, because you\u2019d be climbing the federal circuit of courts, which deals with issues of citizenship and such. The problem is that I\u2019m a poor grad student: I can\u2019t afford a lawyer for you. I\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Roboto.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cOh. Well that is disappointing. How can I get money to help cover the legal fees?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWell, that\u2019s easier said than done. Jobs are hard enough to find in the current marketplace, and also, due to the fact that robots aren\u2019t citizens, they can\u2019t legally work in most states. The laws are ambiguous there as well, but generally state courts rule against robot labor, unfortunately.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cThis seems like a catch-22: I can\u2019t afford a lawyer to get citizenship because I can\u2019t work because I\u2019m not a citizen.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cUnfortunately, that seems to be the state of things\u2026\u201d\n\n\n    Finally, you return to Jules\u2019s apartment and go back upstairs.\n\n\n    \u201cHey, Mr. Roboto, I\u2019ve got something that might cheer you up a bit. It\u2019s called the Internet. It basically contains all human knowledge, in one place. Here, let me plug this cable into your back\u2026 okay there we go. You should be able to browse some websites now. I\u2019d recommend starting with Google; it\u2019s a search engine that lets you find most (if not all) of the available content on the Internet. See if you can\u2019t find something interesting and/or enjoyable.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cSo I just enter a search term into the box?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cYeah, basically. You learn pretty quick!\u201d Jules smiled.\n\n\n    What do you search for?\n", "Breakthrough": "    You enter the search term How to sue for citizenship for free into Google. The first few results seem fruitless, mostly talking about immigration. However, eventually you stumble upon a website called the ACLU. You find out that the organization has a legal team that may take on your case if it\u2019s relevant to their end goal, gratis. You decide to send them an email (after learning how to use email, of course), and await a response.\n\n\n    A few days later, you check your email again, and lo and behold! they responded!\n\n\nDear Mr. Roboto,\n\n\nAfter careful deliberation, the ACLU has decided to take up your case of citizenship for sentient robots in the United States of America! Please contact the number 800-555-0164 to speak with a lawyer regarding your case, and to arrange a meeting to discuss the legal possibilities.\n\n\n    Yours truly,\n\n\nSusan N. Herman, President\n\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n    You immediately forward the email to Jules and begin preparing for the next chapter of your life.\n", "Reactionary": "    As you begin to search for how denisons of the Internet view robots, you find opinions all over the place. Some people and websites, such as ThinkProgress.org, Al Jazeera, and influential blogger Kevin Schmidt believe that sentient robots are on the same playing field as humans and should be treated as such, whereas other sites like Breitbart.com, Stormfront, and 4chan tend to believe the opposite. As you begin reading arguments on the more conservative websites, you start to become slightly depressed about your prospects. While you don\u2019t permanently give up in your hunt for citizenship, you definitely need to take a break from it. There\u2019s too much negativity out there. Maybe eventually Jules will have enough money to hire a lawyer on your behalf...\n", "God Complex": "    \u201cDid you make me? Who are you?

In addition to just being an all around unlikable person, she expected far too much of everyone, as if ANYTHING on this old ass ugly and poorly designed 'library ship' mattered. As if coaxing this broken down wreck from one star to another to 'share human culture and literature' in only the most irrelevant and obscure portions of the galaxy possible could EVER matter. Every single crew member doomed to this hell tour was a burnout, a freak, a frothing fuckwit, a failure. And all of you are far too aware of it. So why, so just why couldn't you be left in peace to wallow in your own apathy and incompetence? But no, the captain had to be so damn insistent on papering the halls with posters about 'pride in one's work' and 'why are we even here if we're not enjoying ourselves???' And stranger things. The inspirational quote generating AI might be going a little wonky there, honestly. Because absolutely everything on this ship was falling apart, and it had been at least a year since High Command had checked in. But that was typical too, because you were nothing to them. It's all in the name of the ship: the USS Cystia. Oh sure, it was supposed to stand for something. But there's no ignoring what it spelled. Cyst. As in a pus-filled boil, in need of being drained and sterilized. That's all any of you are to anyone who matters. Captain Marizal, though. Even by those already incredibly low standards, she was a real piece of work. Always holed up in her quarters scribbling awful, embarrassing garbage about shitty elves or whatever, almost never finishing anything (there's dedication for you!) but the worst thing is, when she DID complete things, she wanted people to read them. Ridiculous. Most people would take one look at this crowd and immediately realize their mistake in hoping for anything but crushing disappointment. But no, when just leaving them in the shipwide recreational communications network didn't work (a network mostly designed to kill time while indisposed, hence the act of using it called 'shitposting') and specific requests for opinions got ignored, she started printing out copies and \"casually\" \"forgetting\" them by \"accident\" in prominent places all over the ship. Frustrated even there, she wound up ordering the crew to paper several villages on developing worlds with the printouts, but the primitives didn't read them either; all it resulted in was researchers complaining that you'd interfered with their development by giving them easy access to toilet paper and fire starting materials. That all led to the mess you're in now somehow, although in hindsight it should have been a good indication she was starting to crack. Oh right...\n", "...the mess you're in now.": "Instead of the usual 'morning' shift change announcements, you were instead woken up by some real quality vengeful lunatic ranting by Captain Marizal, over the intercom.\n\n\"--just one! One! If just ONE of you had read ONE story and given ONE sentence of acknowledgement, this wouldn't have to happen! How long does it take to read 2000 words? 1000, even?

A shuttle had been taken from the bay, and 2.) the captain was on it, before locating said shuttle with sensors and tracking it as it plunged right into the heart of this system's blazing sun.\n\nSo that happened. And it seems something's up with your station computer now, to top it off.

They've been overridden by the captain, and need her voice authorization to unlock.\n\nAlso, the ship's route has been changed, and it's now headed straight for the sun that Marizal plunged into it, albeit moving a great deal slower than the shuttle.\n\nFuck.\n", "Press the blue button.": "A recorded message from a mocking but quite a bit more together sounding Marizal begins to play.\n\n\"So have you figured it out yet? You'll have about five hours left at this point, if you checked out your console right after the intercoms woke you up.

Below that is your console. Most of the controls are locked out, but there's a slot you can put disks in, if you have any. The data reader still looks functional.\n\nThe rest of the crew is around somewhere, you suppose, but those guys are all pretty incompetent and are probably sharing space memes or doing space blow out of each others spacious assholes so, you decide not to worry about them at all and just save the ship on your own.\n"}, "tree": {"Hurry hurry!": {"...the mess you're in now.": {"Press the red button.": {"Back.": {"Press the red button.": "END", "Press the blue button.": {"Back.": {"Press the red button.": "END", "Press the blue button.": "END", "Now what?": {"Look through the sleeping quarters.": "END"}}}}}, "Press the blue button.": "END"}}}}, {"title": "Red Mirror", "stories": {"It has been a hard's day night": "Your closed eyes weigh like lead.

Excitement was rampant about this new discovery as talks were already being made about possible public colonization ventures. What made it so special compared to the other planets that were recently discovered is that it had a source of water and vegetation. Intelligent life had already been confirmed yet any humanoid type creatures were yet to be found.\n\n\nThis came as a surprise, as the planet of Fukon had much similar characteristics and was found only a decade earlier, with colonization already booming on its surface. Though Hulocke was a bit farther away compared to Fukon which would make traveling there a hefty four year journey, though only a year from Fukon. A scouting party of four star cruisers had already been a few months after the discovery with a crew of twenty each to set up a forward operating base and establish diplomatic relations with any intelligent natives if there were to be. Afterwards public colonization would be able to commence.\n\n\nProblem was, all five scout ships lost contact with mother base soon after they arrived. They never touched to the surface however, losing signal around the gravitational pull of the planet.\n\n\nNo transmissions were sent back home causing mother base officials to believe that it was a deliberate act. \n\n\nNo news has been heard to lead any further expeditionary parties at the time of the announcement, and no news of any survivors of the missing hundred crew members has been confirmed.\n", "Weeks Earlier": "\"Man your battle stations you fucking maggots! Do you not see the severity of our situation!\" How did the fleet commander not fucking see the thirty ship fleet of foreign spacecraft that had almost instantly surrounded you all due to the his negligence.\n\n\nHow idiotic you were to sign up for this suicidal scout party in hopes of finding any treasure or claiming land for yourself. You should of just settled with moving to Fukon.\n\n\n\"Sir they just decimated the U.S.S Express!\" Your captain grits his teeth, the fleet commander was on that ship.\n\n\n\"Keep on firing, well take as many of those bastards down to the grave with us!\"\n\n\nFuck that, you weren't about to get sucked into the vacuum of space if those aliens got a lucky shot in the hull like in the case of the U.S.S Panther which was the first ship of your fleet to have fallen. You didn't spend four fucking years of sleeping in cryo and kissing the Captains ass to die like this.\n\n\nLucky for you, your ass kissing skills to the Captain while on the journey for the past few months in which you were all awake had given you knowledge of the hidden escape pod he had in his quarters. With no one paying you any attention it would be fairly easy to dip out while everyone else followed that patriotic fuck to their graves.\n\n\nYou did have a thought of bringing Jessica though, her fat tits had been on your mind for a good portion of the journey and there wouldn't be her boyfriend Dereck to come in between the both of you. But you knew doing so would likely cause attention to yourself and blow your chances of escaping.\n\n\nLetting go of your manned turret and unbuckling yourself from your manned seat you quietly started making your way to the exit of the command station. Making your way down the halls in which everyone's rooms were located, you were relived to see the Captains was wide open. Probably didn't get around to closing it when the alarms starting ringing. Entering his chambers you made your way to the back end where his shower was located.\n\n\n\"Alright how did the combination go.\" You mutter to yourself.\n\n\nGrabbing the shower lever you start to remember what you read in the manual you found during your last break in into his room. The violent shaking all around you gave you a reminder that you needed to do this with haste. First you turn it all the way around counter clockwise, halfway clockwise, a quarter counter clockwise, and finally fully clockwise.\n\n\nA loud automated voice came from the shower head.\"Emergency Pod has been activated, safe travels Commander.\"\n\n\nYou grin wildly knowing that you would survive this disaster after all. Half of the flooring of the shower slides opening revealing a glowing hue of green in which the escape pod was emitting. With the shaking of the ship becoming more severe, you waste no time getting into the cramped chamber. Buttons and levers are before you as you keep trying to remember the manual instructions on how to operate the craft. The first obvious choice was to pull the lever to start the engines. \n\n\nAll the lights started to flicker as you wondered on what to do next. That's when the automated voice returned.\n\n\n\"I have been able to confirm two drop zones based on images taken from the U.S.S Reach database with nearby locations of water capable of sustaining you for a prolonged period of time, please choose now.\"\n\n\nYou look down on the touchpad screen of the escape pod where two options blink, only showing coordinates  and no images of the drop zones that you have been told. Fucking cunt computer could reach into the data base of Reach for this information but couldn't give you a damn picture?\n\n\nYou didn't like this arbitrary decision that had fallen on you, but you had to choose.\n", "Option 1": "\"Drop zone confirmed, good luck commander.\"\n\n\nAs you were just getting comfortable you immediately felt your stomach drop in a instant as thrusters from the back of the pod kicked in, rapidly pushing you away from your ship, no doubt in which everyone on board felt.\n\n\nTaking a look back at your fleet, you looked in awe as only your ship and Reach were remaining, it had seemed that the hostile fleet had ceased its barrage and was now closing in on the two remaining ships. It was obvious that their intentions were to board the ship and take whoever they could prisoner. Landing in Confederation prison was one thing, but being taken by a unknown species is something that you didn't want to experience. The Slug heads on Fukon gave you enough nightmares with all those rape stories on colony women AND men.\n\n\nDescending into Hulockes Atmosphere was even more intense then the kickoff from your ship and it started making your vision a murky blur. A tiny bit of you was wishing that your pod would burn up entering so you wouldn't have to suffer from the inevitable death by starvation since you had no knowledge whatsoever on the ecosystem of this planet, you were just the fucking janitor of your scout ship for fucks sake.\n\n\nNot wanting to think anymore of it, you just closed your eyes and let the increasing pressure of your landing knock you unconscious.\n", "Landing": "You wake up to the beeping of the pods central console. A calming one actually, like that of a sonar. You touch your entire body with your hands to double check that you landed with ease, which came to much surprise that you didn't feel any pain. These pods were notorious for throwing out backs on landing, which would have made things much more difficult obviously. Seeing that you were indeed O.K, you grabbed the lever for the pod hatch and yanked it back, releasing all the air from inside in one big gush.\n\n\nPulling yourself from your feet, you clasped your hands together in anticipation to see where you had landed. Exiting the pod, one look of your immediate area was already making your knees tremble and your stomach churn.\n\n\nDesert.\n\n\nNothing but sandy hills as far as the eye could see.\n\n\n The computer decided that a 'suitable' landing zone would be a butt-fuck Egypt look alike, you've actually been fucked over. Your heart skips beats as you start freaking the fuck out. While trying to look at any positive outcomes while pacing back and forth in the sand you come to a few positive conclusions. The computer said that there was a at water source nearby that would suit you long term, a hidden oasis maybe?\n\n\nA small ounce of relief came to you knowing you wouldn't be dehydrated. The stash of emergency supplies in the back of the pod would also come to your aid. Making your way towards the back of the pod, you place both hands on the bulky handle and with one foot on the pod give it one mighty pull knowing it would most likely be sealed pretty tight.\n\n\nWhat instead happens is that you fall right on your ass with the hatch opening with relative ease compared to what you originally thought.\n\n\nFuck you assumptions.\n\n\nPicking yourself up on your knee, you open the hatch fully to see numerous goodies stored inside.\n\n\nThe first thing you pulled out was a heavy back pack,no doubt with supplies inside. Unzipping the main pocket revealed a hoodie, A book named How to survive anywhere 1001, compass, crank flash-light, large survival knife, and other handy supplies.\n\n\nOf course at the very bottom was the packet of 'death' pills that you expected to see, at least if you were to intentionally die it would be quick and painless, or so the manufacturers of the pills promised.\n\n\nPutting all the items back inside the backpack, you looked through the rest of the contents of the hatch only to find rations of food and numerous bottles of water along with a personal metal water filtration one.\n\n\n'Guaranteed to work with urine!'\n\n\nThat big slogan plastered on the bottle made you shudder a bit as you placed everything back inside the hatch. If you remember correctly, pod food rations were expected to last at least a few months, since most of it was special nutrient pills. What a time to be alive.\n\n\nThe next objective on your agenda was to find shelter, which would have to be your pod as there was nothing else in this sandy hell-hole that would be suitable to sleep in. alright, so you weren't totally fucked as you originally thought, but the prospect of being stuck here in this probably mile stretched desert wouldn't really be good for long term survival in your eyes.\n\n\nThere was still the challenge of also finding the 'oasis' that would most likely be your water source, unless the computer really fucked you over and it was actually some underground spring that you had no chance at getting, but then again it was able to be seen by Reach so it had to practical.\n\n\nThe time seemed to be midway, the sun this planet orbited was luckily almost identical to the one back at Earth. The only major difference was the two giant moons that were easily seen up above, one blue and one a grayish color.You had no idea how long the days were on the planet, but you were sure you heard somewhere that they were longer by a few more hours.\n\n\nYour mind kept on deciding on wether or not to stay put or go out looking for the Oasis, as water wasn't extremely important considering the resources that you already had.\n\n\nYou decide to...\n", "Go look for the water source": "Might as well get the search over with while you still had daylight. With any luck you might also find some wildlife that could turn into a food source. Leaving everything behind except for a bottle of water, some nutrient pills to last a few days, and your compass, you set off on your journey. You would be heading 'north' first.\n\n\nYou didn't even know if this compass was actually pointing to any poles, since it was a wildcard if it would work or not with no knowledge of wether or not this planet had a magnetosphere. At the very least you wouldn't be stuck walking in circles and would be able to backtrack by going 'south'. The sand was a lot more sturdier and thicker than you imagined while walking, similar to that of wet dirt after rain. This though made climbing over the sandy hills a bit more of challenging task.\n\n\nIt only actually took climbing over three or four sandy hills before you were able to see a lush green area from the peak of a hill. Traveling over the remaining distance started to make you sweat as the sun really started to kick in on your skin. The decision of wether or not to bathe in the oasis came to mind since you would be able to clean it with your water bottle anyway.....which you stupidly forgot to bring. Finally arriving at the edge of the lush area, the smell of damp soil fills your nostrils. The numerous trees that surrounded the oasis would be useful if you ever were to build, or just to start a fire.\n\n\nHowever, when coming up onto the water that was in the middle of it all, you were disappointed to see that it was a murky brown mess. Like hell you bathing in that, let alone even drinking it. You wondered what kind of parasites this planet had, you remember studying up on ancient African water diseases back in grade school and knew it was about to reoccur if you so much as touched that contaminated filth.\n\n\n\"RAAJ!\"\n\n\nYou jumped quite a bit at that sudden voice, quickly turning around only to be met by a spear directed right at your face. What freaked you even more the fuck out was the giant seven foot blue aliens that were surrounded you.\n\n\nYou immediately raise your hands in a surrender fashion as the other aliens start positioning their spears mere inches from your chest and face.\n\n\nThe biggest alien out of all of them starts talking gibberish to you, in which you just shake your head in confusion. All the aliens start talking at once, as if deciding on what to do with you. \n\n\n\"FEEEEI\" The large alien shouts, shutting everyone up.\n\n\n\nThese Neanderthals were probably deciding on wether or not to eat you, you think of anything that could be used to protect yourself when you remember that you also along with your water bottle left your survival knife back in the pod.\n\n\nYou groan in frustration which seems to agitate a few of the aliens.\n\n\nThe biggest alien seems to give a few orders as all the other aliens lower their spears except for him.\n\n\nHe then starts pointing with it towards a direction going back outside into the desert. You hesitate knowing that you probably wouldn't be able to find your pod ever again if they dragged you to far out. Seeing your unwillingness to move, the hulking alien gives you a hard push sending you flying on your stomach a few feet forward.\n\n\nWith that knocking the wind out of you, you try regaining your breath while also picking yourself up not wanting to piss of the creature any more that it already was.\n\n\nTalk about wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n\nTwo of the aliens walk ahead of you while the rest are behind, with only the leader right beside you, having his spear behind his back, probably knowing he could still easily kill you without it.\n\n\nYou wondered if these creatures really traveled across the desert just to get to this contaminated shit-hole, or if they actually bathed in it.\n\n\nYou were able to answer your question however when you saw giant lizard like creatures not to far head. Twice the size of a horse, the lizards had the heads of iguanas and the bodies and coloring of a Komodo  Dragon. The lizards hissed it at you hostility as you got closer but a swift kick to one of their bodies by the leader made them whimper in submission.\n\n\nPicking you up like a child, the leader placed you onto the back of one of the lizards while he hopped on right behind you. There were no saddles or reigns and all you could do was grab onto the soft and pudgy skin of the lizard in hopes that it wouldn't move to fast.\n\n\nAfter all the other aliens also dual mounted their own lizards, the leader kicked his own on the side and gave a command, making it start to move forward. \n\n\nYou really were hoping that you just didn't become dinner.\n", "Captured": "It wasn't that long of a ride to get out of the desert surprisingly. The high dunes made it seem bigger than it actually was.  Sand turned into rock as the path got more bumpy. Surprisingly, the komodos did a good job traversing through the rough terrain, with their speed always remaining seemingly constant.\n\n\nThinking that the natives lived  in the mountains, you were a little worried about how deep they might live if such were the case. If so, then your chances of escaping would grow increasingly slimmer. Luckily that didn't really seem to be the case. Traveling upon a steepened path led to the sight of a wide valley down below.\n\n\nDozens upon Dozens of huts stood tall with activity buzzing all throughout the village like area. These savages picked a spot in where it was almost impossible to be found due to the deception of the inhospitable looking mountains. You already started wondering who the chief of all this might be, the group leader who was carrying you could be a fair candidate, but something was telling you that their was someone with a higher authority. To be able to control this many natives however is quite a feat, unless this was a confederation type government.\n\n\nAs the Komodos got nearer to the giant wooden gates of the settlement, the sentries that were up above look down for only a few seconds before the giant gate started to slowly creak open.\n\n\nAs the convoy went through the gates, natives that had been doing various types of labor looked at you with a bit of curiosity before going back to what they had been occupied with as if you were not worth their attention. \n\n\nThat was very odd to you, was this not the first time that these natives had taken a foreigner prisoner. This thought heightened your fears that they were actually going to eat you and if they just shrugged you off as another captured meal that would soon be feasted upon.\n\n\nDeeper and deeper into the village you traveled, the natives becoming more and more dense in numbers the farther in you got. A few of the komodo guards had wandered off from your party, most likely fulfilling their part of protecting the convoy. Though they were replaced with more curious onlookers then from when you first arrived, mainly young looking natives who started to follow the komodos from behind.\n\n\nYou could start to make out a much. much bigger building up ahead compared to the smaller huts surrounding it. This is where they were probably taking you as thats where the group was walking towards. You starting thinking on what you would do if it was their leader they were taking you too. It would be best to be calm, if this dude were to be any bigger than the one taking you now then it would be best not to anger the creatures.\n\n\nThe group of lizards stopped right outside the the giant doors of the mega-hut. The group leader dismounted first before grabbing you and taking you down from lizards back. You stood with curiosity as a much larger crowd stood around you, all eyes focused on you. The group leader gave a few orders to the rest of the other riders who nodded and rode away. Only one other rider stayed with the leader as he grabbed by the bicep and started to escort you to the mega-hut.\n\n\nHe pushed open the giant heavy looking doors with ease as your eyes look inside. The interior was much more extravagant then the exterior. Reminded you of those ancient log cabins or alien hunting lodges. Mounted Skulls adorned the walls and massive pelts acted as rugs all over the floor. A long dining table took up the middle of the place with a numerous variety of food that lay on plates and baskets. The whole site made your mouth water, you only had a few of those shitty nutrient pills when you first landed and this was a much more appreciated sight.\n\n\nAt the very end of the table sat a giant man. Much taller than the one that had taken you but not as muscular. He wore a iron like helmet that had curved horns protruding from either end. He also had quite a bit of armor, his entire torso and upper arms being covered completely in crude metal.\n\n\nWho sat beside him though made your eyes widen.\n\n\nIt was a human girl.\n\n\nYou eyed her with disbelief as she stared back with uncaring eyes. It was then that you were pushed forward, now realizing that you were standing still this entire time. The giant man who you now will refer to as chief called to the alien beside you. His voice was loud and deep enough to echo with power in the mega-hut. The alien nodded and stepped a few steps back away from you.\n\n\n\"You prisoner, come forward to us.\" The girl spoke, her voice also loud but with a polite mannerism. \n\n\nWith her most likely referring to you, you did as were told and made your way over to the two.\n\n\nStopping a few feet away you waited for her to speak again.\n\n\n\"It may not seem like it, but I'm as surprised as you to see you here.\" She says, moving her hands in sign language type gestures while speaking.\n\n\n\"Did they capture you too?\" You ask her.\n\n\nBoth her and the alien chief seem to laugh.\n\n\n\"Wouldn't exactly call it that.\" She says while continuing the sign language as the chief watches the movements.\n\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" You ask another question.\n\n\n\"Awhile, but enough about me. What brought you onto this planet?\" She says turning the questions onto you.\n\n\n\"I'm was apart of a scouting party that departed from Earth to check this place out, only my fleet was ambushed awhile ago and I seem to be the only survivor out of everyone.\"\n\n \n\nHer eyebrows raised.\n\n\n\"That is very surprising, I would have thought that they would have spent a few more decades colonizing Fukon before they even bothered setting their eyes on this place. I also have a hunch on who it was who attacked your fleet.\"\n\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\nThere's a slight pause, as she starts making a few hand gestures to the chief, who nods at them while she then looks back at you.\n\n\n\"There has been a presence of Pirates on this planet for as long as anyone could remember. They come from a cluster of planets not to far from this one, a year or two journey with at least Human Technology. They've been capturing the natives on this planet and have been using them as slaves for quite awhile. Our tribe has managed to secure a prisoner from their ranks a couple of months ago but eventually got too dangerous and we had to execute him. We were able to secure a few weapons whenever we manage to overwhelm any of them if we ever manage to come across their parties but we keep them here as a last resort in the case that they find this place and try to wipe us out.\" She explains.\n\n\n\"If they're space travelers then wouldn't they be able to dominate over this planet without any trouble anyway?\" \n\n\nShe nods. \"All the natives know very well that if the pirates were to put up a much more tougher and forward fight then they could easily dominate over these tribes with ease. Although I have a theory as to why they're doing what they're doing.\" \n\n\nShe looks at the chief again, who nods once more.\n\n\n\"They seem to be using the natives as cattle. They don't want to decimate the entire population but just get enough to have a steady profit for themselves. That seems to be why they don't bother attacking any of the larger villages that we've established.\"\n\n\n\"We've? Does that mean that the two of you control every other village?\"\n\n\n\"Not exactly, each major village has its own chief and they have more of a council in which they are all equal. They usually meet monthly to discuss events and topics in that nature.\"\n\n\n\"I'm surprised that you're this open with sharing all this information.\"\n\n\n\"Well if you're to stay here then might as well get situated with our situation.\"\n\n\nHer words stabbed at your stomach.\n\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\nA smile came to her face, a very, very sinister smile.\n\n\n\"We can't take any chances with you leaving, you could give away valuable information that is best to be kept with us. You either stay here and learn to adapt among us or we shall find a less pleasing alternative in how to deal with you. Less pleasing for you of course.\"\n\n\nSon of a bitch.\n", "Days Later": "It's been a few days since the princess had made you a captive of their village, whose name you found out to be Alyssa. As it turns out the girl was the lover of the chief unsurprisingly. To your surprise however she seemed to have a bit more power than that of the chief, as you've seen her to be the one of giving orders to any natives that came to her, all in that sign language of hers. As it turns out they had a pre-established sign language, which was similar to that back on Earth which made her able to communicate with the natives much quicker. \n\n\nShe made the native that had originally captured you to be your overseer and caretaker. You didn't have much of a problem with this at first, since you had no real intention of rebelling at the moment. The chief had told you that the aliens name was Han. The first night that you slept in Hans hut was a bit of a pain, since he didn't seem to trust for you to sleep on your own and instead had a sleeping bag like mat be put in the corner of his room.\n\n\nAgain, no real problem with this, after all the sleeping bag was pretty warm. The real problem that you had with this living arrangement was the constant number of whores that Han fucked every night. You guess that because of his high status in the community that he was able to ask for women to fuck on the whim. Every night they would moan and yelp for up to an hour before they finally passed out from exhaustion. Yeah at first it did turn you on a little but with each night with the ever so loud noises it just started to become maddening at that point.\n\n\nAlthough all this time being kept up gave you much time to think, if you could drown out their sounds enough that is. You had to find a way to gain yourself some higher prestige in this this community. Enough so that you would be able to live comfortably and with seclusion if you so desired it.\n\n\nOf course you still needed to gain a bit more trust with Alyssa and the rest of the natives before anything of that could happen but the best way to go about that would be to help them with tasks.\n\n\nThen maybe, just maybe you could have some power.\n"}, "tree": {"Introduction": {"Weeks Earlier...": {"Option 1": {"Landing": {"Go look for the water source": {"Captured": {"Days Later": {"Try to look for work with Alyssa": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Secret of the Grass Planet", "stories": {"Author's Note": "This is a story told in the classic \"gamebook\" format.

For the last year you've held the rank of ensign, with one of the most prized assignments in the Fifth Fleet: a post on the Starship Orion!\n\n\nLong forgotten are the days when your future looked bleak and beyond your control. Commander Andrade observed your leadership potential when you were marooned on Giri Minor and helped all of the crash survivors reach safety, and now Captain Javid Ynthramanni is watching your career development as well.\n\n\nThe ship is now preparing to embark on a mission to the planet Folvan, which is inhabited by a primitive race of sentient beings. A team from the Orion will land on the planet and attempt to make contact with the xenoanthropology team led by researchers Dr. Lori Munro and her husband, Ander Dyo, who ceased transmitting signals two weeks ago.\n\n\nThe rumor is that Captain Ynthramanni is considering you to lead the mission to locate the researchers, but as an ensign you are not yet eligible to command a team. Therefore you have put yourself up for promotion, hoping to land the rank of lieutenant before the ship takes off for Folvan and the team is assembled.\n\n\nLieutenants' stripes aren't handed out freely, though, and so you have been subjecting yourself to a battery of examinations and physical fitness tests. You've even made a point of logging many hours in the ship's Gravity Gym, with your workouts set to 2.3 Gs, or more than twice normal Earth gravity. Not coincidentally, that is the measurement of Folvan's gravity.\n", "Page 2": "You're pretty sure everything has been going well so far, although when you've spoken to Commander Andrade lately she's been pretty tight-lipped. This has made you nervous, because perhaps you have not been doing as well as you've thought. Later today you have a meeting scheduled in the commander's office on B Deck for a performance review; perhaps you'll learn your fate then.\n\n\nThe meeting doesn't start for another 90 minutes, and time already seems to be dragging.\n\n\nFor the moment, you are in the Sensor Array Control Room, running diagnostic tests on the equipment to ensure everything will be ready when the Orion arrives at Folvan in a few days. With you are Chief Jod Dansmith from the engineering department, as well as Petty Officer Nacia Stio, a technician who specializes in maintaining the starship's complicated sensor array.\n\n\nThis is your first assignment with Stio, so you don't know much about her, other than what you can see now: a technical-minded subject matter expert engrossed in her work. Chief Dansmith, on the other hand, is a celebrity on board the Orion, probably as charismatic as any of the command officers, with a robust personality and a love for life. He is a service veteran, with an impressive career across multiple starships.\n\n\nYou once asked him where he was from. \"Earth,\" he said, \"or more precisely, Missouri.\"\n\n\n\"Misery?\" you said incredulously.\n\n\n\"No, Missouri,\" he corrected you, but the distinction meant nothing to you. You've never been to Old Earth. Dansmith flashed you a dour look, but then explained, \"It means I see things exactly as they are, and I take no bull from anybody.\"\n", "Page 3": "You're the officer who has been tasked with guiding the diagnostic project to completion, but you get the distinct sense that it's Chief Dansmith who has been watching you. It's made you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious to be scrutinized by someone so much more experienced than you. Could it be he resents being assigned to a team led by an ensign as young as yourself? It doesn't fit his reputation, but the possibility nags at you all morning long.\n\n\nAs the diagnostic tests are nearing completion you are surprised by the smell of smoke. Dansmith and Stio seem to be oblivious, so you try and identify the source. The smell, faint at first, leads you down the narrow room to the lateral sensor control board, where you find an unusual device plugged into the sensor controls.\n\n\nWasn't Chief Dansmith working down here a little while ago? Before you can get too close, the device flashes. Now you see a plasma energy leak emanating from the wall. Within seconds the room will be filled with toxic gases and radiation--but something seems fishy.\n", "Page 15": "Your suspicions aside for the moment, the priority is to evacuate the compartment.\n\n\n\"Plasma leak!\" you shout. \"Everybody out, now!\"\n\n\nStio briefly flashes a doubtful look, but she sees the greenish cloud filling the control room and promptly exits. Dansmith, on the other hand, seems to be willfully ignoring you.\n\n\n\"Chief,\" you say, \"I said we need to clear this room now.\"\n\n\nHe is focused on recalibrating the forward transtator, but even in the profile of his face you can detect his disdain. \"It's minor,\" he says. \"With a leak that small we'll have half an hour before we reach critical radiation levels. If you want to be a starship captain someday, kid, you can't get bent out of shape over every little plasma cloud.\"\n\n\nYou are stunned by his cavalier response to this crisis situation. You know Chief Dansmith is flat out wrong; plasma energy leaks are notoriously unpredictable, and the slightest charge could ignite a deadly explosion.\n\n\n\"Chief, please, we need to evacuate the control room right now and see if we can shut off the plasma conduit--\"\n\n\n\"I can't just leave,\" he says, barely hiding the fact he is losing his patience with you. \"If I leave this transtator now I'll have to restart the realignment protocol, and lose an hour's work!\"\n\n\nAt that point you do something you've never done before. \"Chief, we need to leave now. That's an order!\"\n\n\nWith that, Dansmith's expression softens instantly. \"Well, since you put it that way, Ensign.\" He flashes you a grin and steps away from the transtator, and you follow him out of the control room.\n\n\nYou still get the sense he's up to something, but there is no time to indulge your suspicions now. \"Help me find the control valve for the plasma conduit--\" you start to say, but then you notice Commander Andrade standing in the middle of the corridor.\n\n\n\"That's enough, Lieutenant,\" she says. Dansmith nods to her silently, and then he guides Petty Officer Stio away down the corridor, leaving you and the commander alone.\n", "Page 16": "Andrade walks into the sensor control room, and a moment later returns with the strange device you found a few minutes earlier. The smell of smoke is gone, you notice. \"It's a portable simulator,\" she explains. \"Are you ready for your evaluation now?\"\n\n\nFeeling more than a little confused and embarrassed, you follow the commander to the nearest lift, and then ride with her to B Deck.\n\n\nCommander Andrade's office, located one level below the main bridge, is small but tidy, as if it's a space where she rarely spends much time. A black desk curves through the middle of the room, and the only adornment is a family portrait standing beside her computer terminal. The image box shows, in three dimensions, a young couple about your own age with two small children sitting in a park. This must be her son and his family; the daughter-in-law is very dark-skinned, nearly true black, but Andrade's son is more moderate in tone, just slightly lighter than his mother.\n\n\nThe lieutenant commander settles into her chair, the image box at her right elbow, and with a gesture she invites you to pull up another chair from against the wall.\n\n\n\"You'll be pleased to know the captain has approved your promotion,\" she says. \"Allow me to be the first person to congratulate you, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\nYou are still too stunned to feel grateful. \"So you were testing me back in the Sensor Array Control Room... ?\"\n\n\n\"We actually signed off on the promotion yesterday,\" Andrade says. \"Frankly, you've been performing so well that it was never in doubt. But Captain Ynthramanni had some questions about how you'd stand up to someone with so much more seniority than you. So Chief Dansmith and I devised this simple test with the simulated plasma leak.\"\n\n\n\"I suspected he was up to something,\" you say.\n\n\n\"But your first instinct was to get your people out of harm's way,\" she says. \"I saw that quality in you back on Giri Minor. The captain wanted to see it in action once more before agreeing to let you lead the contact mission on Folvan. So let me congratulate you again, Lieutenant!\"\n\n\nThis may be the best news you've heard ever since you earned your commission! While you've been trying your hardest not to get your hopes up, landing this mission has been your primary goal since you learned of Dr. Munro's disappearance. And now it's yours!\n\n\nYou barely got to know Dr. Lori Munro back on Giri Minor; in a crisis situation, there was little time to socialize and develop friendships. With the exception of Commander Andrade, you've had no contact with any of the other survivors since you were rescued by the Orion. But Dr. Munro's initiative, when she made use of her medical training and took charge of the wounded passengers, really made an impression on you. Her actions during that difficult incident inspired you to play your own role to help ensure the survival of everyone who had been marooned with you on that dusty, deserted planet.\n\n\nAnd then there was Ander Dyo's good-natured sense of humor, which he maintained despite his injuries and the bleak reality of the situation. You were intrigued by what little you knew of their xenoanthropology mission to the so-called \"Grass Planet,\" but you never got the chance to ask them more about it. Not long after you were whisked away from Giri Minor to safety, the survivors of the crashed transport vessel went their separate ways.  \n\n\nBut now it will be your responsibility to locate this wife-and-husband team. The days of babysitting passengers on an unnamed transport are long behind you. At last, your career in the Astral Navy is taking off!\n"}, "tree": {"Author's Note": {"Secret of the Grass Planet": {"BEGIN STORY": {"Page 2": {"Page 3": {"If you evacuate the room and shut off the plasma conduit, turn to page 15.": {"Page 16": {"Page 119": "END"}}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Survivors", "stories": {"Survivors": "\n", "Introduction": "Jimmy Thompson, or \"Jim\" to his friends always thought of himself as an average mid-western guy. He grew up on a ranch near the base of the Rocky Mountains in Montana. He was used to getting up early and working hard all day long. He got average grades in high school and was really more interesting in spending time outdoors than in anything that was taught in the classroom.\n\nInstead he spent long weekends out camping and hunting in the mountains and really came to know the mountains as his home. But when high school was over, his parents convinced him to move along and try new things, so he headed to the local community college. He managed to take it for some time, but he really wasn't that interested. After he received a 2-year degree, he moved on to try something new, this time the U.S. Military.\n\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and headed out to serve Uncle Sam. He spent four years in the infantry, moving around the world and guarding people, bases, and other things that he really didn't understand. Once again, he was about average -- except in the area of marksmanship. He was one of the best when it came to the rifle range. Despite the ease he had with those skills, after his four year term was up, he left the service and returned to his family home in Montana.\n\nHe quickly found life on the ranch to be what he wanted. He spent long hours working around the family ranch and eventually built his own house on some adjacent land. He was satisfied with life on the ranch until the day that was forever known as \"The Event.\"\n\nPeople in places like Montana never really understood \"The Event\" like others in the rest of the world. What happened was clear to everyone else: a number of small nuclear bombs were set off in various places around the country. All the largest cities were hit: New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Miami, St. Louis, Detroit, Dallas, and dozens of others. A massive coordinated attack took place hitting all the population centers at the same time.\n\nPeople in Montana knew something had happened simply because all radio and television broadcasts suddenly stopped. Internet backbones were taken out, so for a time there was simply no Internet. While power generation was on at first, power outages quickly became the norm. And without power or broadcasts, it was some time before anyone in Jim's small town had any idea what had happened.\n\nAs things started to get back to \"normal,\" whatever that was, people started to gather just to find information or news about what was going on. People who were employed in technical areas, or anything related to information were out of work and had no food or supplies. Most people in Jim's area were used to farming and had many supplies, but they still ached for information and news of the outside world.\n\nFinally the sheriff of East Ridge County had a general public meeting. He said that they needed to take stock of the County and the town of Twin Hills. He was going to set up a logistics area, a defense area, and would then see about setting up a town government with the elected officials that could be located. Then they would try to contact other counties and towns to see if they could re-establish contact with the rest of the country. Anyone who could help should meet him at the Sheriff's office first thing in the morning.\n\nJim attended the meeting and had to decide what to do. He could stay with the county and try and help the local people with the sheriff, or he could take one of his horses and head down to the state capital to see if he could link up with the government forces there to help out.\n", "Helena, MT": "When Jimmy gets back to his ranch, he packs up some supplies and prepares for a few days in the outdoors. It is nothing that he hasn't done before, so most of the supplies are ready and easy to pack. He double-checks his tent and blankets -- it is late summer, so the cold should not be an issue, be he doesn't want to be stuck outside overnight with the bugs if he can help it.\n\nHe checks out one of his rifles and places that on the horse. He also has a pistol on his hip, but that's not really out of the ordinary in this part of the country. Things haven't gotten too confusing yet, but he figures it is only a matter of time before the robbers will start showing up. He places a couple boxes of extra bullets in one of the saddlebags.\n\nAfter Tarkus, his large black horse, is loaded, Jimmy climbs on and rides over to his parent's house. When he gets there, he sees his father sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair, talking to his mother. They stop talking as Jimmy rides up to them.\n\nHis father looks over at Jimmy and says, \"So, you're headed out, are you?\"\n\nJimmy replied, \"Yup.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence before his father continued, \"Where to?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd head down to Helena. Some folks there might need my help.\"\n\n\"Well, some people here might need your help, too, you know.\"\n\nJimmy nodded then said, \"Yup. I dunno, but maybe I can help find out what is going on down there and get things set to right soon.\"\n\n\"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\nThere was another pause before Jimmy's mother spoke up, \"Jim, you be careful now. No one's been out of the town in days, so no one really knows what you'll find out there. I don't want this to be the last time I see you.\"\n\nJim smiled and spoke to his mother, \"Ma, I'll do all I can do. If I made it through the Marines, I think I can make a quick trip down to Helena.\"\n\nThere was another pause and the only sound was the creaking of the rocking chairs on the porch. Finally Jimmy said, \"I'll be on my way now. See you soon.\" He turned his horse and started down the dirt path away from his parents house.\n\nWhen going by car, the trip to Helena was just a couple hours. But by horse, Jim figured it would take him a few days. He didn't push Tarkus, but let Tarkus set the pace. They headed down the side paths, but eventually Jim wanted to take a look at the Interstate Highway. He guided Tarkus along the paths and headed around through the mountains and towards Interstate 90.\n\nWhen he reached the top of the last rise, he reigned Tarkus in. He could see miles in each direction along the Interstate. There was absolutely nothing moving that he could see. There were a number of different cars and trucks stopped at various places along the road. The road looked clear, with most of the vehicles pulled to the side, but there were a shocking number of abandoned vehicles there. Clearly their town was not the only one with problems related to power and gasoline. He turned his horse back into the mountains and towards the city.\n\nJim spent two nights camping in the woods and hills as he worked his way towards the city. On the morning of the third day he crested the last hill blocking his vision of Helena. When he climbed over that rise, he was shocked by what he saw. The city looked like it had been in a war. Not many buildings were destroyed, but there were fires and car wrecks all around. He could see some groups of people moving about, even from a distance. Some looked to be just destroying windows and anything else they could break.\n\nHe turned once again and headed for the FBI buildings that he knew were on the northern outskirts of the city. He could see the sun glinting off the various barbed-wire fences surrounding the compound, even from a distance. As he got closer, he could see a number of armed guards in uniform all around behind the fences, watching him closely.\n\nHe rode right up to the front gate. There were a number of guards there, and the gate was closed. There were large concrete barriers in place as well. Jim called out, \"Hey! I'm here to help!\"\n\nA guard called back, \"Who are you, and what do you want to help?\"\n\nJim thought that was a little odd, but he called back, \"My name is Jimmy Thompson, USMC. I thought Uncle Sam might need me.\"\n\nThe guard looked around, ensuring that Jim was alone, then he carefully opened the gate while a number of others stayed at attention with their rifles pointed out the gate. The called gestured and called out, \"Alright then, come on in Thompson. We can always use a few more Marines in here.\"\n\nJim went in and was quickly ushered to the leadership building. An older man stood up and introduced himself as Major Alexander. The Major explained that the group was still trying to get organized, and they absolutely could use some more experienced soldiers. He said that the group was trying to get organized to support the U.S. government, or what was left of it. There were not a lot of orders coming out of any central command, but there was a command trying to get organized now, and they would work together to restore order over the country.\n\nThe major explained that right now they needed help on two different teams: the leadership team and the firearms team. The leadership team was setting up to do some planning and logistics to ensure the safety of the military. The firearms team was, obviously, working on securing firearms for the defense of the military and Helena base.\n\n\"Well, Thompson, you can pick either one of the teams, both need help right now. Either way I'm giving you the rank of sergeant right now.\"\n", "Leadership": "\"Major, I'm going to help out with the leadership team.\"\n\nThe major nods and replies, \"Fair enough, we need good men there. Go on over to building C, out the door and to the right.\"\n\nJim headed out the door and easily spotted the large warehouse building with a large letter C on the wall. He went in through the main door. Inside the room was indeed a large warehouse, but with cubicles set up as far as the eye could see. The place looked like an accountant's nightmare with messy desks, some smashed computers, and papers all around the place. The first five cubicles had people working in them, but the rest were completely empty. The place smelled like sweat and garbage.\n\nAs soon as Jim walked in, one of the people at the desks jumped up and said, \"Hey! Who are you?\" His hand quickly moved to the sidearm on his side while the other workers stopped working and looked up.\n\nJim held his hands up to show that he was unarmed and replied, \"Easy now. I'm Jimmy Thompson. The major sent me over here to help out with the leadership team.\"\n\nThe other man visibly relaxed and held out his hand to Jimmy saying, \"Ah, that's good. Things are crazy around here. I'm Sargent Wilkins, 22nd Support Division. I was stationed here before all this craziness, so I guess I'm sort of in charge while we figure out what's going on. We still don't have power here, so we're trying to find what information we can in these old printed records. Before the power went out, we managed to dump some piles of data, but we didn't get a chance to sort it. Come on over, I'll show you what we're doing.\"\n\nJim thought to himself, \"This doesn't look much like a leadership team, this looks more like the paper-pusher team. But if it helps get this country back on track, I'm going to support it.\"\n\nHe followed the Sergeant to the tables and worked with him, sorting through the papers. They were currently trying to identify locations for potential food sources, and which areas around Helena were to be annexed. Jim asked him about the annexation plans.\n\n\"Well, we're trying to help set up a new American government. We're identifying which areas would be easier to obtain and hold so that we can ensure we get off to a good start. I'm sure once we've got a good base of people, we will be able to expand out until one day we've got the entire old United States back together again. In the meantime, we know we're going to run into some pockets of resistance, and we want to identify those early and either avoid them or take them out, depending on the threat and depending on the resources that might be available. You can see the big plans over there on that map.\"\n\nSargent Wilkins pointed over to a wall where there was a large map of the area around Helena. He walked over and looked at it where another man was drawing a few more lines. The map included all the roads, cities, towns, and also geographic features. Much of the area around Helena was marked \"New America.\" Some of the areas to the south were marked in red. He followed the map back to his small hometown and saw that area was marked in yellow. He called over to Wilkins, \"Hey, what are these colors for?\"\n\n\"They indicate where we're going and what we're doing next. The areas in green are areas we already control as part of New America. The red areas are areas that we either don't want, or are so dangerous there's no point in trying to take them until we're stronger. The yellow areas are the target areas -- they have something we want, usually supplies or food, and we're pretty sure we can conquer them with the forces we have now.\"\n\n\"Conquer them?\"\n\nWilkins laughed and continued, \"Well you don't think most of those places are just going to give us their supplies and food willingly, do you? I mean sure, we'll walk in and ask them to join us, but if they don't, we will be prepared to force them. In most cases, those places have more than they need, and we need their supplies to feed all the people in cities like Helena. It's not like we're going to carpet-bomb them or anything, we're just making sure that everyone is going to do their fair share.\"\n\nJim nodded and said, \"Oh, that makes sense.\" He thought to himself, \"I'm sure Ma and Pa would like to help others, so I don't imagine there'd be any problems with them joining New America.\"\n", "Coordinate Plans": "Jim starts looking over the plans. As he does, a few others show up to report to him, and he gives instructions to prepare for the movements. He works with men to determine the number and types of trucks that will be needed, and also to coordinate space in the trucks to bring back supplies. He has to balance the need to take arms and ammo with the need to have space to bring back the supplies to the city.\n\nHe works with some others who bring in maps and discuss fuel supplies and how they can move the number of men required. He helps to plan the directions the trucks will take and how long they will be in the field. He hears about the limited supply of batteries for field radios, and the availability of very old field radios that can operate with hand cranks and off truck battery power.\n\nAs they finish making the plans, Jim takes a deep breath and prepares to depart on the assault.\n", "Ending #1: Jailed": "As Jim is about to leave, one of the other Sergeants walks into the room and takes the Sergeant Williams aside. He shows a map to the Sergeant and then gestures towards Jim. Jim turns to leave, but Sergeant Williams calls out, \"One moment, Thompson, before you go.\"\n\nJim stopped and turned around. Sergeant Williams was spreading out a map on the table and gesturing to it while the other man pointed at a few locations. Williams nodded a few times, then spoke quietly to the man. He looked up at Jim and quickly scampered out the door.\n\nSergeant Williams said, \"Thompson, you drew up these plans, didn't you?\"\n\nJim nodded without saying a word.\n\nWilliams continued, \"And you're from East Ridge, aren't you?\"\n\nJim started to realize where this was going as he nodded again. A door slammed open behind him as two men quickly came into the room.\n\nWilliams stood tall and said, \"And you picked out a route that would leave East Ridge alone then, didn't you?\"\n\nJim didn't speak, but saw the two men step closer to him from the rear.\n\n\"You decided to save your own town and screw the rest of the country. That's exactly what we're trying to avoid here. We need to save everyone, no matter what it takes. If a few people have to die so we can have a united country again, then that's what it takes. Dammit, this is a war, Thompson, and there's no place in a war for those who don't have the guts to do what it takes.\"\n\nThe men behind him grabbed him by the arms as Williams kept talking, \"People are going to have to make sacrifices here, and since you're not willing to make them, we will make them for you.\" He looked up at the two men and said, \"Take him away.\"\n\nThe guards roughly grabbed his arms and pushed and shoved him through the door as they took his sidearm from him. Down a row of stacked boxes and behind the edge of the building was another door with a barred window. They shoved him inside and Jim found himself inside a jail cell. There was one small barred window looking outside, a small hole in the corner of the cell, and nothing to sit on. The door slammed as the guards left him to his fate in the solitary cell...\n", "Carry Out Plans": "Arriving at the south edge of town, the army group, led by Jim, can see that the town has pushed a few cars into the road to create a roadblock to stop anyone from entering the town. As they push forward towards the cars, two armed men step out from behind the cars. Jim recognizes them as Yim and Yar, two brothers that have lived in the town for their entire lives. They stand in front of the cars, blocking the way into town.\n\nOne of them (Jim never could tell them apart) called out, \"Sorry, this town is closed. No one is allowed in, and we're to stop anyone who tries. You need to turn around and go back where you came from, or we'll drop you where you stand. We're not messing around, and we really don't care who you are.\"\n\nJim stepped down out of the army truck and called out to them, \"Hey, fellas, it's me, Jim! No need to get all crazy on us!\"\n\nThe brother who spoke first held his hand up and said, \"Sorry Jim, while you might be welcome here along, you're not with all those others. We have our orders and we're going to defend this town with our lives. We don't want to shoot you, but if you don't up and turn that truck around right now, we won't have any choice.\"\n\nJim paused, taken aback by the bolt statements, as he tried to decide what to do.\n", "Ending #2: Jailed": "Jim says, \"No. There's no way I can do that, and I can't believe you even asked me to do it. As a matter of fact, if people like you are in charge of this new army, I don't want to have anything to do with you or it. I'm going home and you better not even think about coming up to East Ridge County, or you're going to encounter a 'pocket of resistance' that's going to give you a lot more than what you bargained for. Do YOU understand?\"\n\nAdams shook his head and sat back down. \"You know, Thompson, I really had hopes for you. But if that's how you see things, then we only have one option. Guards!\"\n\nBefore Jim has a chance to move, two large guards appeared and grabbed his arms. They were clearly waiting for him and expecting him to resist. They yanked his arms behind his back and quickly closed a pair of handcuffs on his wrists.\n\nAdams stood back up and said, \"Thompson, this new country is going to be an orderly country and you're out of order. If you can't find a way to get along, then you're going to be placed somewhere where you won't bother others and encourage disorder.\" He looked up at the guards and said, \"You know what to do with him.\"\n\nThe guards roughly grabbed his arms and pushed and shoved him through the door as they took his sidearm from him. Down a row of stacked boxes and behind the edge of the building was another door with a barred window. They shoved him inside and Jim found himself inside a jail cell. There was one small barred window looking outside, a small hole in the corner of the cell, and nothing to sit on. The door slammed as the guards left him to his fate in the solitary cell...\n", "Armory Confrontation": "Jim walked around the rear of the truck and opened the canvas flaps. Inside were two dozen armed soldiers. He looked down as he said, \"We've got resistance ahead. They are armed, but not experienced. Get a couple guys in place here by the tires and when you're ready, take them out so we can get into town.\n\nA number of the men scrambled around as Jim stepped aside, keeping the truck between he and the town. Yim and Yar had no idea what was going on until two rifle shots broke the silence and the two men crumpled to the ground. The soldiers piled back into the truck and Jim jumped in the cab. The truck rumbled ahead, easily crashing through the cars that were set to block the road.\n\nJim gave the driver directions through town towards the armory. A few startled people came outside to watch the fast-moving heavy truck rumble through town. Jim looked out and saw a flash of a yellow dress as the rolled past the general store where people were lined up awaiting food. Two blocks later they turned left and started to approach the armory.\n\nThe armory was in a dip in the valley, a large concrete building surrounded by a high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. The gate was jammed with two pickup trucks, one slammed into the other, completely blocking the gate -- the only way in was to climb over them. Jim knew that the trucks wouldn't even slow down the large army transport, but he told the drive to stop when he saw past the trucks.\n\nBehind the trucks there were piles of sandbags and a number of men. They had built a machine gun nest and it looked like there was a working 50-caliber machine gun tucked in behind the sandbags. It looked like there were about a half-dozen men guarding the armory, but what really stopped Jim was that he could see both the sheriff and his father dug in there.\n\nJim leaned out the window and called out, \"Come on now, we just need the ammo. No one needs to get hurt here!\"\n\nThe sheriff called back, \"Jim? I can't believe that's you. But that's good, right? You can help us. Hey, we don't need to fight here, let's work together and everyone can help everyone, right?\"\n\nJim stared through the windshield at his father as he pondered what to do next.\n"}, "tree": {"": {"Jim should head to the capital and see what he can do to help at the government headquarters...": {"Jim should take their offer to be on the leadership team...": {"Jim should try to make modifications to the plans so that his town is red.": {"Continue...": "END"}, "Jim should leave the plans alone and continue to do his job, after all, each town needs to do their share to help out in this new world.": {"Continue...": {"Jim should refuse to carry out the orders and refuse to take supplies from his own town.": "END", "Jim should consider the overall welfare of the masses and lead the group to his town to obtain supplies.": {"Jim should not back down and should push the requests from the new US government to get the town to help out everyone else.": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "Sympathy for title change", "stories": {"Choose a Character as the starting point for your story:": "\n", "Allen": "Hello Allen.\n\n\n       You are sitting in a small town hotel room with a bottle of Captain Morgan\u2019s at your typewriter. You\u2019ve been ruminating and writing all evening about something and the rum doesn\u2019t seem to be helping with either anymore. You\u2019ve forgotten why you are bothering to write a letter to this bitch. Oh yeah. You remember an exercise a high school counselor once made everyone do, should you ever be in a \"no-win\" situation with someone and needed a safe place to vent your thoughts.\n\n\n        \u201cJust write them a letter,\u201d she\u2019d say in that cheerfully obvious way. \u201cTell them everything you are feeling and why.

So you started writing to the woman you held in your hands earlier today. It was strange at first, addressing a letter to someone you\u2019d only met once, who may have never even known your name. How could she still manage to keep you up at night?\n\n\n         As you are roughly inserting a fresh sheet of paper into your mom\u2019s ancient Brother word processor, you accidentally knock the remainder of Capt.

You bet that if anyone were to read this, they\u2019d probably think you were a sober, maybe. Getting bored and thirsty still, you look around for something else to drink and find the bottle of Cuban rum Dad gave you tonight at dinner. With the Cuban embargo now over after 30+ years, Dad jumped at the chance to have a case of the stuff shipped over. It\u2019d been his father\u2019s favorite drink.

Your swirling gaze lands back on the typewriter. Ding! A bulb flickers on above you from the bed\u2019s headboard. You are full of action. Without giving much more thought to it, you quickly finish by signing the letter: \u201cSincerely, F.U. (Not my initials)\u201d. Stuffing it into one of the still damp hotel envelopes, you scribble in the center the would-be recipient\u2019s name, and then your own in the upper left corner. The saliva you slobber the glue on the back with is about a 5:1 rum to spit ratio.\n\n\n           Shoving the letter and the rum into your backpack, you pat your butt to make sure you have a lighter on you and dash out the door.\n\n\nHow would you like to get there?\n", "Drive your car there,": "       You struggle to find the keyhole on the driver\u2019s side door for a couple of minutes. Every attempt is leaving a deep scratch in the paint around it. Whateveritsapieceofshitanyways. Getting frustrated, you bend down awkwardly to force the key into the lock and turn, the key quickly breaks in two within the lock. Only then do you see your reflection in the window and realize that it isn\u2019t even your car you're trying to unlock. You back away guiltily and change your mind about taking that walk.\n", "Walk through the town in the dark ?": "           For some reason you feel like patting yourself on the back as you pass your car in the parking lot and head towards the old cemetery at the end of the street. You stumble your way through the sleeping town, feeling like the only person awake for miles around. You pass a run down gas station that has a big rusted tin sign with the word \u201cGULF\u201d in big letters on a dull orange background. Stopping to steady yourself on the posted public notice sign in front, you let your head lean against it as you try to make your eyes focus on the spinning words of the construction notice. Does that say they\u2019re building a Planned Parenthood Clinic?! No that can\u2019t be right. You close one eye and try again. Coming soon! \u201cTANNED SANDLEWOOD\u201d A Stationary Boutique.\n\n\n           \u201cHAH!\u201d you scoff a bit too loudly as you push your body upright and shuffle along down the street. \n\n\n           A minute later and you are here. The orange glow from the street lamps don't go past the gate entrance so you must use your phone as a flashlight. Your destination is towards the back of the flat, wide cemetery, in the older section of graves. Frogs, crickets and cicadas alternate their pulsating night songs from the thicket that fences the cemetery in on three sides. Quieting when you get too close, resuming their screams when you move away. You focus on the ground to avoid seeing the shadows of headstones that dance and scurry from the light of your phone.\n\n\n           Standing in front of the dual-name bearing headstone, you pour out all but a sip of the rum bottle over the grass. The bottle makes a clink when you cheers the stone letters of a man\u2019s name, so similar to your own, then toss your head back to kill the rest of the fiery liquid yourself. That done, you hastily sidestep to your right to face the other, newer engraving of a woman\u2019s name. Swaying and catching yourself, you pull out the envelope and hold the tiny flame of the lighter to its edge. You hold it at arms length and watch as the ashes blow and scatter over this woman\u2019s new residence. The flaming envelope licks hungrily at all but the top left corner. The folds of paper smoke, curl, and blacken into soft black snow that disappears into the darkness of the cemetery. Before the flames can taste your fingers and your own name, you blow it out. Letting the small bit of unburnt paper, still throbbing a red glow at its edges, fall into the dew-rich grass where you stand.\n\n\n           You hear something rattle the chain link fence from the darkness only a couple feet in front of you. You couldn't be less curious to know its source. More pressing than the dark and the strange noise is the pressure building on your bladder.\n\n\n           \"Whatever you do,\" you remind yourself aloud while clumsily gathering up your stuff, \"don't piss on anyone's grave. Oh please don't let me piss on anyone's grave right now.\"\n\n\nHow would you like to leave?\n", "Walking calmly out of the cemetery...": "           Once you are safely on the outside of the cemetery, you breathe a sigh of relief and even laugh a little as you bask in the orange glow of the street lamp. Stepping into the street directly underneath the lamp light, the gentle tapping sound your steps make is loud in the utter silence of this town at night. Feeling vindicated and a little cocky from the relative success of this excursion, you reward yourself by positioning your legs shoulder length apart and unzip.\n\n\n           Letting your head fall straight back on your shoulders, you look up into the street lamp with deep felt appreciation as your bladder empties into the street. Oddly, the lamp promptly goes out. However, you aren\u2019t plunged into darkness like you thought you\u2019d be, in fact, the words on the cemetery gates seem more legible than a moment ago. The whole scene is actually getting brighter and brighter and, is that music you hear? Over your right shoulder the white light and the quick beating of a bongo drum and tambourine grow brighter and louder, along with the mechanical hum from an engine. You're still peeing though, in the middle of the street. Your drunken logic reassures you that as soon as the car sees you, surely they'll slow down and go around.\n\n\n           \"HOO-hoo, HOO-hoo...,\" The blaring radio is louder now. They still haven't slowed down? Oh shi-\n\n\nOkay, decision time:\n", "Bill": "Hola Bill.\n\n\n          The suit you wore new to Maria's quincea\u00f1era last year feels like it's about a mile up your wrists and ankles. It's itchy as hell in this heat but you push both sleeves up anyway so they bunch up on your thin biceps. The effect looks better than any of Padre's old baggy black suits anyway. Like Michael Jackson when he sings, \"Rock With You\".\n\n\n         After Padre's funeral, you are tasked with getting a pack of cigarettes for Madre. You welcome the chance for some time to yourself.  You take your time as you walk through your father\u2019s hometown. The signs driving in had all said \u201cENIGMA, GA\u201d on them, here in the square, the word is on everything: \u201cENIGMA BAPTIST,\u201d ENIGMA HIGH SCHOOL, HOME OF THE RED DEVILS,\u201d \u201cENIGMA ROADSIDE MOTEL\u201d. Remembering your task, you search the line of storefronts for la gasolinera. At the far end of the street, you spot the large bright red-orange GULF sign; the town\u2019s only petrol station. You turn to face it and shuffle that way.\n\n\n         On your way, you pass a number of strange things. Right in front of the cemetery entrance there is a large, dark red stain on the sun-bleached asphalt of street. There are two dark black tire marks that either lead up to, or away from it; it\u2019s hard to tell. Someone must have hit an animal. A big one. You almost go right past the gas station when you hear a commotion coming from the parking lot of the motel down the street. There, a man in pajamas is yelling angrily at a police officer with a notepad as he wildly gestures points at the driver's side door of his brown Cadillac Coupe Deville. However, the strangest thing of all happens when you finally get to the GULF station parking lot. You rub your eyes to be sure it isn\u2019t a mirage. Nope. The old attendant pumping gas into the blue Mitsubishi Mirage is singing along animatedly to the song on the car\u2019s radio,\n\n\n         \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste!\"\n\n\n          Your heart feels as though it\u2019ll burst out of your chest. Padre? You stand there in the doorway of the gas station and gape at the man you saw closed into a coffin this morning and wonder, How can this be? Just as you and the attendant are about to lock eyes, you are called away by the sound of someone inside with a thick accent yelling at you to close the door. The accent belongs to a dark, elderly man working behind the counter. His smile is so big on his face that the size of it forces his wrinkles to drape over the corners of his mouth like curtains on a stage. Disarmed by his goofy grin, you half-smile back until you remember what today was. Timidly, you ask in your own thick accent,\n\n\n         \"A pack of Virginia Slims, please sir.\"\n\n\n         \"\u00bfPara ti?\"\n\n\n         A part of your brain dances with glee at hearing your native tongue again. You miss home so much. Father's family is nice enough, but your English is only so good and translating gets exhausting quickly.\n\n\n         \"No, para mi Madre se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\n         The old man decides he likes the look of you and introduces himself as Manuel, and buys you a Coca-Cola. In no time he has told you all about himself and his home in Quintana Roo.\n\n\n         Noticing your unseasonably warm clothes, he guesses you are coming from \"el funeral del Capit\u00e1n\".  You can only manage a nod. Then, with tremendous sympathy, he asks who the deceased was to you.\n\n\n         \"Mi Padre,\" you say solemnly.\n\n\n         \"Indudablemente,\" says Manuel. One corner of his mouth pinning up half the wrinkles on that side of his face. The curious way he says this makes you feel like he already knew the answer.\n\n\n         \u201cAH LYNN!\u201d Manuel suddenly calls out over your head loud enough to be heard in space. A moment later the attendant from outside is at your side. Up close, the resemblance you saw in him before is gone. You resist the urge to cry.\n\n\n         \u201c\u00bfTodav\u00eda tiene esa carta? Asks Manuel to the old attendant. After a strange pause, the attendant reaches into his dirty jumpsuit pocket and pulls out a wrinkled bundle of dingy colored papers with faded black text. With two hands, he places it upon the dull grey change plate on the counter between you and Manuel. Without a word, he nods to Manuel and then at you before returning outside. Manuel leans across the counter and looks you in the eye before asking if you could be trusted to deliver something for him. You feel a tinge of uneasiness about the seriousness of his tone.\n\n\n         \"Si. Of course.\"\n\n\n         Nudging the yellowed, wrinkly, twice folded bundle of paper towards you on the counter, Manuel switches to English and says in a grave tone,\n\n\n         \u201cThis is to be delivered to your mother. It was originally addressed to her. Be a good son and see that she gets it.\u201d\n\n\n         \"Si se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\n         \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing mi amigo: Do not read it. You mustn\u2019t read your mother's mail. Do you think you can do this simple thing? Take the letter, don\u2019t read it, give it to t\u00fa madre. \u00bfS\u00ed o no?\"\n\n\n         You pick the letter up carefully from the little tray, it feels so fragile with age that you worry putting it into your suit pocket will ruin it.\n\n\n        \u201cAh! Muy bueno. Say, what did you say your name was again, mi amigo? \u201cBill,\u201d you say? Like Dollar-Bill, no?\u201d He chuckles and grabs a dark glass bottle from below the counter and slides it over to you. \u201cHere, let\u2019s have some rum with that Coke!\u201d\n\n\n        When you finally take your leave, you tuck Madre\u2019s cigarettes into your coat and glide through the parking lot back to the motel. Your stomach feels very warm and silly inside. From the sidewalk you hear Manuel\u2019s deep voice singing out to you from the station door,\n\n\n        \"Muchas gracias se\u00f1or. \u00a1Despedida!,\u201d\n\n\n         You turn the corner and are out of sight of the GULF sign a moment later. Looking at the bundle of papers in your hand, you wonder what the letter could be about.\n", "Constance": "Ahoy Constance.\n\n\n           You are sprawled out naked in a tangle of bed sheets waking up slowly to the gentle swaying of the Captain\u2019s quarters. You\u2019re on a small cruise liner somewhere near Monterrey in the Gulf of M\u00e9xico en route to Havana. It\u2019s been two full days without one merciful breeze and you can tell that the effect of this stagnant heat is infecting the crew and the other passengers with a listless anxiety and a standing order for more booze. Only when your arm feels the cool emptiness of the other side of the bed do you recollect that the Captain had to get up early today to perform the vows for some lovesick pair that met aboard three days ago. The groom's an American passenger with a business venture in Havana, the bride's a Mexican steward that apparently gave incredible turndown service. You sigh and roll over to reach for a cigarette and a match on the night stand. Blowing out the thick white cloud, you slip on the black satin underwear that had gotten lodged in-between the sheets at the foot of the bed. Standing in front of the small shaving mirror over a wash bowl, you admire the changes of your body that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks. Your breasts are decidedly rounder, giving them a gentle shake with cupped hands. That soft place below your belly button feels firmer to the touch everyday now.\n\n\n           The Captain returns and finds you posing like this. Without missing a beat, he slams the heavy cabin door with exaggerated strength. Looking at you with dramatic intensity, he plays out his favorite Bogie scene that he only does when he catches you being supremely enrapturing. Blushing when you catch his dark look at you in the mirror, you turn around to listen as he recites the already dated movie reference:\n\n\n           \u201cGo ahead and shoot, you\u2019ll be doing me a favor.\u201d\n\n\n           You can\u2019t help but shake your head and laugh at his antics. You turn back to the mirror and focus on applying your deep red lipstick. The Captain sits down on the bed and kicks off his boots. Out of habit you go to pour him a drink, but as soon as you pull the cork out from the dark glass neck of the rum bottle, the smell of it hits your nose and sends you running for the wastebasket. It occurs to you that now is as good a time as any to give the Captain some news.\n\n\n           Returning to your own quarters, you are enjoying how the evening dress you wore to dinner last night, looks in the light of day. It hugs your cleavage to the point of bursting. Your hips can\u2019t help but swing a little more with each step. The Captain had behaved exactly as you had anticipated after hearing the news. Being 20 years your senior and with a wife back in the States already, you knew he wasn\u2019t exactly going to be passing out the cigars any time soon. But you were certain, and correct, in trusting that he would ultimately do right by you, and his child. After being assured that there was no question about it, he excused himself after lunch to begin writing a series of \u201cdifficult letters\u201d, saying the two of you would discuss happier plans in the morning. Feeling satisfied with him and the solemnity of his reaction, you took your leave only after applying a slow, cool kiss to his temple. He would never leave you now. A child would ensure that. The Captain being the kind of man he is, all he needed was adequate motivation. All any man seems to need is adequate motivation. A sly smile creeps up on your painted lips as you turn the corner in the direction of your own cabin.\n\n\n           A porter is waiting for you outside your cabin door with a shiny metal platter in his hands. On the platter is a single envelope. Mistaking your smile to be at him, the porter beams back and says in a hoarse voice,\n\n\n           \u201cBuenas tardes Se\u00f1orita DeVille, hay una carta para ti.\u201d\n\n\n           Letters usually mean one thing. Your father. Ever since he married that woman she\u2019s successfully turned him against you. More than like he is again threatening to cut off your allowance if you don\u2019t return home from traveling soon. Annoyed by the expectation of your father\u2019s letter and this porter\u2019s annoyingly toothy grin already, you dismiss the pleasantries by lowering your icy gaze to his hands. He holds out the elaborate tray to you. On it lays one limp, sorry-looking, yellowed, smelly envelope. The front of which is preposterously addressed in a scribbled violent hand:\n\n\n           \u201c\u00a1Despedida Constance Lucinda DeVille!\u201d\n\n\n           Beyond the address, the presence of the mail is immediately peculiar to you for several reasons: Knowing the ship hasn\u2019t made port in over a week, communications with anyone outside of the vessel just don\u2019t happen unless your radio picks up stations off of the Gulf. In broken English he explains that it may have gotten lost in the shuffle at the last port.\n\n\n           \u201cBut is here now, Se\u00f1orita,\u201d he adds with a sympathetic smile. Again extending the platter to you.\n\n\n           Incensed and suspicious at this man\u2019s laissez faire attitude about your mail, you snatch it off the tray a bit too forcefully. Even with the air being thick with moisture and that clinging stench of seawater, the paper feels bone dry, almost brittle. As if it\u2019s been warming under a sunlamp. Stranger still, it also has a strong aroma of smoke, so much so that it stings your eyes having it so close to your face. You bring the envelope to your nose anyway; do you also detect the sour smell of rum on it? Your lunch is shifting in your stomach again, assuring you that it definitely is the same scent.      \n\n\n           Your blue eyes narrow at the porter\u2019s sweat stained uniform. You take note of his bloodshot eyes and general appearance of exhaustion. The mystery of the letter\u2019s strange delay and even stranger condition solved, you shake your head in accusatory judgment as you sneer,\n\n\n           \u201cYou can be sure that the Captain will be hearing about this delay along with the rum you\u2019ve stolen, and subsequently wasted by spilling all over my mail. Muchas gracias se\u00f1or. \u00a1Despedida!\u201d\n\n\n           You shut your cabin door hard in the porter\u2019s distressed face to drive your point home. The only thing that doesn\u2019t fit is the smell of the rum. You have to hold your hand over your mouth and nose in an effort not to gag as you turn it over more carefully. It\u2019s uncanny how much the smell of it reminds you of the rum you always pour for the Captain. It\u2019s a nice brand, one of his favorites, and it\u2019s only found in Cuba. Not something anyone on the crew would have the means to get their hands on, let alone splash it around all over the mail. It is just too expensive for that.\n\n\n           Looking again at the writing on the front, you don\u2019t recognize the handwriting. Outside your own family, very few people would know how to get in touch with you, let alone where you were in the first place. Irritatingly, you can\u2019t yet know from whom the envelope hails as the upper left corner looks as if it got burnt off somehow.\n", "Go show it to the Captain and follow up on your threat!": "       Giving it a moment\u2019s consideration, you start to worry about how the Captain might receive your behavior with this. Clearly it was the mood swings talking, but you ought to think about how this might reflect back on him. That, and the repercussions of offending the ships\u2019 head portman with another three weeks until they stopover in New Orleans, was probably the last thing you ought to do. You figure you really only have two choices: Decide to spare the Captain the trouble and resolve your affairs on your own,\n", "Start to leave to find the porter and explain yourself": "           When you are exiting your cabin, you hear the Captain\u2019s voice from down the galley. He asks to speak with you for a moment.\n\n\n           Closing the door to your cabin slowly, he starts telling you that one of the crew, his porter Manuel, came to him just a moment ago fearing for his job on this ship.\n\n\n           \u201cManuel has a daughter your age in Quintana Roo who\u2019s facing some very trying times, all his pay is sent directly to her. He\u2019s been a part of my crew for a decade now and more than once has his dedication to it moved me to offer him a drink, or three. But he never accepts. He doesn\u2019t drink. So, what I came here to ask is this: Do you know why my best portman would come to me begging for his job?\u201d\n\n\n           Your heart sinks.\n\n\n           \u201cUhh.\u201d\n\n\n           The captain waits patiently for your answer. You remember the letter in your hand and hold it up to his face animatronically. He pulls back a step wrinkling his nose,\n\n\n           \u201cOh my, what is that?\u201d You let him take it from you and watch as he examines it.\n\n\n           \u201cSmells just like an ashtray and my rum wrote you a love letter,\u201d he says with the hint of a smile in his eyes. You titter and avert focus on the rug beneath your feet. You nod your permission when he asks to open it. Involuntarily feeling yourself hold your breath. One scan of the first page and you see his brows quickly furrow together. Another minute or two pass and his expression hasn\u2019t changed. You move closer to him to get a look for yourself and he instantly pulls away. Crumpling the letter into his pants pocket in a manner that tells you it isn\u2019t going to be handed back to you.\n\n\n           Speaking quickly, the Captain says that the letter is quite nonsense, and hardly intelligible. Better to let him throw it out for you. Acquiescing to his grave tone, you give a little sigh of relief at this and nod in agreement.\n\n\n           Once you are alone in your cabin again, you notice the burnt envelope lying on the floor. The Captain probably dropped it in his rush to return to his post. As you bend down to reach for the dingy white paper a sharp pain grips you in your abdomen. Holding your sides and doubled over with throbbing pain, you pull yourself over to the service call button on the wall. Using your forehead, the only free appendage, you push the button till it glows white. It\u2019s all you can do to crumple onto the floor with head propped onto the bed and await the steward. The same one that got married this morning.\n\n\n           Wondering at the likelihood of the only steward being on duty the evening of her wedding, you watch as the room seems to be pulling away from you. You are rocked into a lull as your senses focus in like a tunnel to the motion of the ship. It feels just like being in a great big cradle.\n", "B \"No Way, Jose\"": "So The Twilight Zone was too much for you? No matter.\n\n\n((If you haven\u2019t already done so, open and read the attached letter now and then begin again by choosing a new character to start reading as.))\n", "Read the letter as soon as you're out of sight": "To: Constance Lucinda DeVille,\n\n\n       Greetings Constance. You don\u2019t know me. (How could you?) But I definitely know you.\n\n\n       Don\u2019t be creeped-out; it\u2019s all secondhand of course. Fragments. Hearsay. And besides, who could honestly say they \u201cknow\u201d you?\n\n\n       I\u2019m told that once, very briefly, you held me in your arms. I shiver to think I was once in the arms of a _____. I won\u2019t say it. I\u2019m too superstitious to judge the dead, but you know that one Rolling Stones song, - you know the one I'm thinking of... - I like to imagine they were talking about you.\n\n\n       However, I will attempt to give you the benefit of the doubt as I tell you every awful thing I know about you and try to understand why I feel so resentful towards you. Having empathy for people is just one of these dumb qualities I admire about my dad, so I give it a try every now and again for his sake. Have you two ever met? - My father, that is. Yes, I know it may have only been a cursory acquaintance to you, but you certainly left him with an unforgettable impression. OH! Would it jog your memory if I referred to him by what you probably knew him better as? Does \u201cYour ATM,\u201d sound familiar? No matter. He\u2019s actually a really nice guy. Maybe even a good guy. Guess you\u2019ll just have to take my word on that, won\u2019t you?\n\n\n       So what\u2019s your fucking problem Constance? Being heiress to some blue-blood family up North disenfranchise you from being a decent person? Bet they had a lot of annoying expectations on you and were like, so controlling of you, and what you spent their money on. They must have had a lot of opinions about who you married too. Probably already had someone in the company set aside for you too. I can\u2019t imagine growing up in that world though. Living in a big mansion in 1950s Philadelphia crammed full with servants and dumbbells and pristinely white gloves. Being shipped off to boarding schools where you\u2019d have classmates with names like, \u201cRockefeller,\u201d and \u201cOnassis\u201d must have been intense. While this sheds some light on why you are the way you are, it by no means excuses you from taking responsibility for your crimes. Did you really think you were above the law? Polygamy, forgery, social security fraud, and evasion of arrest for over 50 years. Psh, ain\u2019t that some bullshit?! Did you think hiding away in Mexico for 17 years would change anything back home for you? Must\u2019ve been so embarrassing for your \u2018hoity toity\u2019 family to have their daughter\u2019s arrest warrant dragged up in the public every year. Your father was the Yale football team captain in the 1920\u2019s, right? Bet all his old school chums at the country club discussed all your drama over tumblers of rye and shook their rich, influential heads in sympathy for your father. Speaking of parents, ever wonder how you were at the job? No? Figures. No matter, there\u2019s already this perfect song written about it: \u201d...Pleased to meet to you, hope you GUESS my name!\u201d\n\n\n       It\u2019d be one thing if you had left after the funeral in 1981 and never reached out to any of the family ever again. But you didn\u2019t. You just kept living. Every 4-5 years or so, Dad would give us all the news that you were, in fact, still kicking around somewhere. Not that anyone was marking a calendar or anything! Honestly, until your death, I don't think I'd ever thought of you as living. Weird right? You\u2019ve been a ghost to me for decades, and you're only just now dead!\n\n\n       Seriously though, what\u2019s it like to ask your son for money every other year and not know one single thing about him? Do you bother with the formalities of \u201chow have you been?\u201d or, \u201chow are your kids? Your new wife?\u201d Or do you dive straight into your troubles and monetary needs? I feel sick thinking of it. Or that\u2019s because of all the rum. Whatever it is, it\u2019s making my heart sore too. Imaging myself in his position, I don\u2019t think I would have been as good to you as that.\n\n\n       One time he told us about how, when we were kids, you sent for him (another withdrawal!?), and not knowing what to bring his own mother (other than money), he brought pictures of his children to show you. How long did you look at our faces before you gave the pictures back? One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thou - MONEY PLEASE!\n\n\n       My, what a lovely grandmother you made.\n\n\n       So why am I so fucking angry? Who are you to me anyway? Who am I to judge you and your maternal instincts? The answers are that the offense is not so much from any disappoints I hold in your failures as a person or as a grandparent, that is what it is. What I can\u2019t seem to let go of is the idea of you raising a child, your child, as if he were nothing more than afterthought, a burden, a bank teller. Like why even go through the trouble of getting pregnant when you clearly never wanted a family? And don\u2019t say that you did because if that were the case, then we would\u2019ve met by now and I could know for myself what the big fucking deal about you was. I\u2019m not complaining, though. Too many people have made it clear that I should feel lucky for that. And I guess I believe them.\n\n\n       I blame all my idealistic, sentimental and romantic expectations of parenthood solely on my father. Because somehow your son managed to make his kids feel that way about the role. As if it were a privilege. That is the real mind bender; maybe I should be thanking you for being such a horrible matriarch instead of criticizing you, otherwise my dad wouldn\u2019t be who he is and then I wouldn\u2019t be who I am and on, and on, and on.  \n\n\n       So, whilst I call you out for being an evil ice queen, I suppose I should also thank you for getting knocked up and stuff. I hope you didn\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that that wasn\u2019t exactly what happened. Scheming a bun into your oven in order to force a (mostly) honest man into uprooting his entire life for one with you. Real subtle. What? Did you suppose everyone would just assume Grandpa WANTED to drop his whole life, (complete with wife and kid #1), and have another baby at age 50?? Did you ever stop to consider what he was giving up? A family, a career he loved, a peaceful retirement in Georgia, a reasonably simple life of dignity?\n\n\n       No wonder those WASPS up in Philly never sent you any help. Not even when you and Dad probably could have used it the most. They were probably more than a little relieved at the chance to cut their loses with you.\n\n\n       I\u2019m still pissed though. When you up and died on us, what you really did was sever any and all ties I might\u2019ve had with that past. With my past and with my family. Because you never cared enough to share your life and experiences with me, I will never get to hear anyone\u2019s but Dad\u2019s memories of his father. You and your family will never be anything but black and white photographs. I\u2019m probably the only person in the world who may have put up with your BS long enough to hear about you and what you know. What was life like for you in Mexico during the \u201860s and \u201870s? How was the food when you\u2019d go on tours thru Europe in the \u201840s? Hell, I\u2019d even be curious to just find out what the fuck you\u2019ve been doing for the past quarter century we\u2019ve been on this rock, floating in space. How\u2019s an old broad like you so busy you couldn\u2019t call me up in all that time? Not even once.    \n\n\n       Today it was my privilege to hold you, Constance. Took a scoop of you in my hands and felt as you got under my fingernails a little. I lifted you up. But you are so much more like powder than I anticipated, that a cloud of you mushroomed out everywhere from the makeshift, World Market urn we\u2019d been keeping you in. I had a sneezing fit when you started getting into my nostrils and onto my suit pants. In our last moment together I held out my open-face palm and watched the breeze scatter you around until my hand were empty again. Just a little dusty, now. Then I slapped my hands together with satisfaction like a baker with flour, glad that the task was finally over.\n\n\n       Maybe by writing this all down, it\u2019ll somehow lift all this anger and resentment off me and place it onto you, the source of it all. Being that you are literally dust scattered on the ground right now, the load shouldn\u2019t be too burdensome.

And besides, who could honestly say they \u201cknow\u201d you?\n\n\n       I\u2019m told that once, very briefly, you held me in your arms. I shiver to think I was once in the arms of a _____. I won\u2019t say it. I\u2019m too superstitious to judge the dead, but you know that one Rolling Stones song, - you know the one I'm thinking of... - I like to imagine they were talking about you.\n\n\n       However, I will attempt to give you the benefit of the doubt as I tell you every awful thing I know about you and try to understand why I feel so resentful towards you, even without having had the misfortune of knowing you. Having empathy for people is just one of these dumb qualities I admire about my dad, so I give it a try every now and again for his sake. Have you two ever met? - My father, that is. Yes, I know it may have only been a cursory acquaintance to you, but you certainly left him with an unforgettable impression. OH! Would it jog your memory if I referred to him by what you probably knew him better as? Does \u201cYour ATM,\u201d sound familiar? No matter. He\u2019s actually a really nice guy. Maybe even a good guy. Guess you\u2019ll just have to take my word on that, won\u2019t you?\n\n\n       So what\u2019s your fucking problem Constance? Being heiress to some blue-blood family up North disenfranchise you from being a decent person? Bet they had a lot of annoying expectations on you and were like, so controlling of you, and what you spent their money on. They must have had a lot of opinions about who you married too. Probably already had someone in the company set aside for you too. I can\u2019t imagine growing up in that world though. Living in a big mansion in 1950s Philadelphia crammed full with servants and dumbbells and pristinely white gloves. Being shipped off to boarding schools where you\u2019d have classmates with names like, \u201cRockefeller,\u201d and \u201cOnassis\u201d must have been intense. While this sheds some light on why you are the way you are, it by no means excuses you from taking responsibility for your crimes. Did you really think you were above the law? Polygamy, forgery, social security fraud, and evasion of arrest for over 50 years. Psh, ain\u2019t that some bullshit?! Did you think hiding away in Mexico for 17 years would change anything back home for you? Must\u2019ve been so embarrassing for your \u2018hoity toity\u2019 family to have their daughter\u2019s arrest warrant dragged up in the public every year. Your father was the Yale football team captain in the 1920\u2019s, right? Bet all his old school chums at the country club discussed all your drama over tumblers of rye and shook their rich, influential heads in sympathy for your father. Speaking of parents, ever wonder how you were at the job? No? Figures. No matter, there\u2019s already this perfect song written about it: \u201d...Pleased to meet to you, hope you GUESS my name!\u201d\n\n\n       It\u2019d be one thing if you had left after the funeral in 1981 and never reached out to any of the family ever again. But you didn\u2019t. You just kept living. Every 4-5 years or so, Dad would give us all the news that you were, in fact, still kicking around somewhere. Not that anyone was marking a calendar or anything! Honestly, until your death, I don't think I'd ever thought of you as living. Weird right? You\u2019ve been a ghost to me for decades, and you're only just now dead!\n\n\n       Seriously though, what\u2019s it like to ask your son for money every other year and not know one single thing about him? Do you bother with the formalities of \u201chow have you been?\u201d or, \u201chow are your kids? Your new wife?\u201d Or do you dive straight into your troubles and monetary needs? I feel sick thinking of it. Or that\u2019s because of all the rum. Whatever it is, it\u2019s making my heart sore too.

The military academy. It is here that you, like many before you, have come to learn the art of war. There are certain occupational hazards to the job, but nowhere near as much as 20th Century Earth. Soldiers are no longer just so much cannon fodder, they are the backbone of the army.\n\nThe United Guns formed some time ago, to unite the bickering states that sprang up when the planet Terra Proxima was colonized. Evolving out of a simple mercenary outfit, they are now the global peacekeeping force, employed by the Combine of Free Nations to enforce the law, defend the member states and uphold human rights. They also take on such jobs as explorers, investigators and scouts. Pretty much all the exciting jobs are offered by them.\n\nSo, at Tel-Takir, you and your squad have trained over the past 12 months, training in the use of weapons and armour, drilling and practicing battles, getting a whole lot fitter and bonding with each other. You have fought each other in mock battles, run inhuman distances, run inhuman distances with heavy packs over an obstacle course, practiced with vehicles, demolished a bunch of targets and trained your reflexes and instincts.\n\nThe squad all call each other by callsign, which have become your nicknames. Your nickname is Sentinel, and your squadmates are Outrider, Gambler, Steelhead, Acrobat, Savant, Dozer, Switchblade, Nemo, Cub, Hawk, Guardian, Psych, Nemesis, Gearhead, Harridan, Melodrama, Radio, Red and Blue. With you that makes a full squad of 20.\n\nYou have gotten to know Gambler, Psych, Gearhead, Harridan and Nemo, helping each other out and generally chilling out together.\n\nGambler is an optimist, trying to take everything lightly. He is also true to his nickname, having won and lost an equally huge fortunes playing Quil'zak. He is your best mate among the squad, as his optimism and light, joking mood means you can never feel angry around him. His natural friendly personality and good humour have led him to be the leader of the squad.\n\nPsych is pretty cold, a sniper, a hunter. He is the squad's best sharpshooter, whether it's sitting up an ambush for an unsuspecting victim or in the heat of battle with beams and bolts flying around him. He joins in the Quil'zak sessions, but he mostly just watches. He seems troubled, but you havent been able to find out what troubles him\n\nHarridan's specialty is driving, flying and racing. A real risk taker, but she has never crashed yet. She and Gambler are rivals at Quil'zak, and games between them are often a talking point. She has picked up Gambler's optimism as she relentlessly tries to thrash him at his own game. She is honest, blunt and straight to the point.\n\nGearhead is an engineer; able to modify and improve practically any weapon, repair any piece of hardware, hack into any computer and (to the frustration of his squadmates) jam any communicator. He tinkers with hardware in most of his spare time, and so isnt seen much at the Quil'zak board. Gearhead is a cynic, and loves taking every opportunity to deride any piece of machinery, often making 'improvements' while still in the cockpit of vehicles.\n\nNemo has come top on the squad ladder as the best fighter. He is skilled at taking the fight to the enemy, and whenever in a training battle, his battle cry will make his opponents shake as they realise they could soon be in a world of pain. Despite this seemingly violent nature, he is a great ally to his teammates, the backbone of the squad, and an overall nice fellow, always taking time to help people if they look like they need it. He has lost countless hands of Quil'zak to Harridan and Gambler, eventually giving up the game in disgust. He now spends most of his time reading.\n\nIt is graduation day for you and your squad. You all stand up in front of the entire Academy after your term of gruelling training. As all the graduates take the oath, you wonder where you will go, an exciting array of exotic locations flooding your mind. You are last to recieve your helmet, which signifies you as a graduate, but eventually the time comes. You walk forward to the chief instructor; Lt. Staalko. He swears you in with his deep voice, not needing a mike to make himself heard:\n\n'Do you, on your honour, swear to uphold the United Guns code of honour?'\n\n'Aye'\n\n'Then take your helmet, Soldat Sentinel, and consider yourself graduated!'\n\nYou take your helmet and walk over to where your comrades are standing.

Peace settled over the world, all was calm. The people of Earth lived a sustainable lifestyle, finally at peace with the planet itself. A golden age. The people of Earth then looked to the stars, as the spirit of exploration rose. Colonies were founded on the moon, Mars and further out, expanding mankind's control. With advances in technology, space travel became affordable, and owning a spaceship was like owning a car. Yet this was not enough. Fleets of robot spaceships were sent out beyond the solar system, to discover new worlds. One star system was found that contained an Earth like planet, of all the thousands of stars scouted. The planet was named Terra Proxima, or Next Earth.\n\n\n\nA fleet of colonists colonized the planet, and millions were made trading, huge robot cargo ships hauling exotic goods from Terra Proxima and high technology from Earth. Unfortunately, people are always ready to fight over resources, and the colony split into squabbling states. Piracy was common, a popular pastime and respectable job even, as corruption spread throughout the colony.\n\n\n\nThe year was 2735 when a small band of starfighter pilots hired themselves out as guards. They escorted the robot ships out of the system, taking out 5 pirate raiding parties. They decided to go into buisness as a mercenary outfit, and the United Guns was formed. Their ranks swelled quickly, and a war against corruption was fought for 12 years, The United Guns being paid by the Sol Goverment and trader unions to stop the wave of piracy and theft. By the end, there were no pirates left, some having joined the United Guns to stay in employment.\n\n\n\nIn the year 2761 a space station above the planet was attacked and destroyed. The raiders used unidentified technology and were very well armed. Several more of these alien spaceships have been spotted, and the UG is currently searching for them.\n\n\n\nThe year is now 2779, and the United Guns is currently employed by the Combine of Free Nations to keep the peace. They are the best military force on Terra Proxima and stand ready to repel any attack. A United Guns base was destroyed a week ago by an explosion. The cause has been unidentified, but the evidence points to sabotage. A similar incident occured when all UG heavy weapons simultaneously desintegrated, sabotaged during production.\n\n \nThe Jumpsuit\n\n\n\nThe United Guns protects it's infantry with a suit of armour. The suit dissapates the energy from all impacting projectiles, halting the slug in it's outer layers. The suit also has a climate control to protect the wearer from heat and cold. The suit is light enough to allow infantry to run or march comfortably. However, too much energy can cause the suit to overload and cook the person inside as the suit absorbs energy. The suits can also dissapate electrical energy or the energy projected by plasma guns, but these weapons are designed to bypass dissapating armour, and so they can inflict more damage.\n\n\n\nSometimes tower shields of thick metal are used as cover for a squad under fire. They are often used when in exposed areas when defending.\n\n\n\nThe Weapons\n\n\n\nMost modern weapons on Terra Proxima work by shooting a tracer dart, connected to the gun by a beam of plasma. The dart appears to ignore gravity as it is held in a straight line course by a magnetic field, the same used by the plasma itself. When the dart hits something, it transfers the energy of the plasma beam into the surface it hit. Plasma weapons are useful because the ammunition cost is small compared to ballistic weapons. Indeed, some plasma weapons (The most common being the Plasma Pistol) recharge themselves and retrieve darts, giving virtually unlimited ammo. Plasma weapons are found from lightweight, useful backup weapons, to standard battle rifles, to massive artillery pieces.\n\n\n\nRocket weapons are less common and much more expensive, but are still used to attack vehicles, land, air or space. They are more accurate at long range and more effective against vehicles than plasma guns, and the advanced rockets used now have seen off virtually every vehicle. Rockets are used less and less now as tanks are obsolete, but are still kept in case...\n\n\n\nBallistic weapons are quite rare, used only in the event of a supply cut off. Modern ballistic weapons are powered by compressed air (from a compressor or gas pellets) and can fire a wide range of things. they are mainly used for firing stones if plasma weapons run out of ammo.\n\n\n\nVehicles have dwindled in the wars on Terra Proxima; Prone to rockets and expensive. Aircraft are still used, fighters, bombers, helicopter gunships, transports and Mammoths (floating gun platforms and aircraft carriers), but tanks and light attack vehicles are obsolete. The only land vehicles use are the troop transports and assault walkers, which have a point defense matrix that can shoot down missiles, coupled with tons of armour plating that can absorb a LOT of punishment.\n\n\n\nArtillery on Terra Proxima is carried by a squad in parts and set up. The guns are light and as small as possible, to make return fire difficult. Artillery is usually Plasma based, firing either a single, huge-calibre bolt, affected by gravity and bursting on impact, or a storm of rapidly fired plasma beams. These are vital to UG troops trying to hold ground against superior numbers.\n\n\n\nTactics and Strategy on Terra Proxima\n\n\n\nOn Terra Proxima, Infantry are the dominant force. A well mixed infantry division can overwhelm almost any opposing force. Artillery is also important for extra firepower, and this is often used to support the infantry. Long range missiles are not used here as an Anti Air matrix or Anti Air soldier can shoot them down easily. When a force digs in, with covered infantry, AA matrix and well placed artillery, there is no easy solution. Infantry fight it out toe-to-toe, while the artillery engage in duels at long range.\n\n\n\nAssault Walkers are sometimes used at the front lines to pierce enemy formations but they can be brought down with rocket soldiers and artillery, making it a costly and risky investment.\n\n\n\nMammoth air units, with their heavy armour and awesome capabilities, are the only things able to attempt a quick victory. The Mammoth will move overhead and use it's guns to try and break the infantry and artillery into fleeing through bombardment. The Mammoth will also deploy troops and helicopter gunships to aid the ground fight.\n\n\n\nHowever this is dangerous, as the troops will usually attempt to board the Mammoth through capsules launched from the ground, and will attempt to capture it or destroy it from the inside out.\n\n\n\nIn mobile warfare, Mammoths will attack each other and board each other, also deploying troops on the ground to secure a foothold.\n\n\n\nHover Roads are required by most vehicles to run. It is possible to disrupt a section of a road, grounding all hover vehicles, another reason to use walkers.\n\n\n\nWhen launching a suprise attack, paratroopers are used; long ranged missiles are shot down by AA matrices and slow,lumbering bombers will as well. Stealthy paradrop planes can pull it off though. Troops can be dropped by capsule or parachute, the capsule breaking open on impact without harming the soldier. \n\n\n\nTerritory\n\n\n\nThe United Guns has bases all over the Combine of Free Nations. The academy of Tel-Takir is in the Free Zone, a peaceful, beautiful country, and also the seat of the UG's Headquarters.\n", "That Night": "After the usual celebration of food, drink and gambling, you climb into your bunk and rest. Your squad will find out it's posting and ship out there tomorrow.  Your eyes close as you slip into the depths of sleep...\n\nA loud noise wakes you up.\n\nThat's an explosion!\n\nYou jump out of your bunk, put on your helmet, walk over to the barracks window and peer out. A squadron of fighter aircraft is in the sky, judging from the helmet's night vision. The explosion appears to be one of the gun towers and the checkpoint barricade. And...\n\nOh crap!\n\nParatroopers are coming in from all directions. This makes sense, a missile would have been recognized and shot down, bombers sooner than the missiles, but light fighters and paratroopers could mask themselves against electronic detection. As the first paratroopers hit the ground near the destroyed gun tower, you run to the alarm and hit it. Sirens and klaxons blare and searchlights light up. But even in a fair fight, the paratroopers would be impossible to defeat by the UG forces here. As your squadmates start to wake up, you throw on your jumpsuit and pack, also taking your plasma pistol (record the plasma pistol in the items page).\n\n'We're under attack! Get up!'\n\nYour squad gets their jumpsuits on, and picks up their gear. A voice sounds over the intercom: '...501st squad, fall back and meet the 3rd division at Tel-Ignato! All trainees, get to the space transport Tel Academia! I repeat, we are under attack!...\n\nYou and your squadmates scatter and run, with calls of 'See you at the rendezvous!' filling the air. You set off at a run, away from the barracks and into the forest training zone. Here you can plan your next move before the place is swarming with troops.\n\nYou could head for the breach in the wall. This would be the quickest way out, but you would be sure to run into enemy troops. Or you could head for checkpoint Epsilon, which would lead you away from the fighting, but also from your rendezvous.\n", "The Breach": "I'm not afraid of those bastards! They're going to get what's coming to them!\n\nYou move out of the forest zone and over to the rock zone. You dash from outcrop to outcrop of boulders, which are the only cover you'll get. After half an hour of scuttling in this way, you can see the breach. The ground slopes downward until it gets to the ruined tower and wrecked steelcrete barricades. You crouch behind a cluster of boulders, get your binoculars out of your pack and look. A team of 3 soldiers are there standing guard. Apparently the main force in inside the facility. Luckily they don't look ready, they are obviously bored and tired. \n\nBunch of incompetents...\n\nThey are carrying plasma carbines, which don't have much range. You sneak downhill and crouch behind a chunk of debris. You could probably sneak around, but you can also fight these guys, even with the obvious 3-1 disadvantage. Choices, Choices.\n", "Fight the sentries": "Taking cover behind the closest large chunk of rubble, you pop up, aim, and shoot one of the sentries through the hip. He runs away screaming with pain, while the others take cover behind rubble.\n", "Combat Choice": "You crouch behind the rubble, planning your next move...\n", "Evade the sentries": "You creep past the sentries, aware that if they detect you, you will be at a massive disadvantage.

The sunlight creeps over the lush grasslands and hills of Earth, creating a beautiful vista, well worth waiting for. The planet is at peace, It's people finally living a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nApproximately ten light years away, on a similar lump of rock, another day breaks. The sun spreads it's fingers through the lush grass, light forest and rolling hills of the Free Zone. This Terra Proximan sunrise, however, does not look upon peace. Though thinking has changed in the past few centuries, the hatred and selfishness of humanity remains. After centuries of enlightenment, aggression clings on.\n\nA continuous thumping is heard in the distance. A dull rumble as Mammoths ponderously hover through the sky. Sharp whines as fighter aircraft zoom through the air like hawks. And on top of this, smaller sounds can be heard. The chatter of troops, the background noise from radios, humming electronics and whirring machinery.\n\nTel-Nadr comes to life. The massive fortress city is a hive of activity, from the sentries changing shifts to the patrolling Assault Walkers to the reconnoitering fighter aircraft. The fortress city itself is made up of a town in the centre, with aerodromes, barracks, bars, shops and a thriving, if small, metropolis.\n\nThis is surrounded by a massive ring of defensible buildings, with concealed security devices and anti air matrices on their roofs. A hover road runs through the base, with a destabliser for when enemies arrive.\n\nBeyond the buildings there are massive open minefields,stretching for miles into the distance to prevent flanking. Around the minefields there are yet more AA matrices, daring a paratrooper assault.\n\nThe minefields are not present near the hover road, so these areas have been fortified with trenches, bunkers, gun turrets and security scanners.\n\nThe Taktat troopers cannot outflank the fortress, and an attack from the air with missiles would be shot down. Paratroopers in stealth craft might stand a chance in the air, but once the base was alerted they'd be trapped.\n\nThey cannot cut supplies. They cannot sneak in. They will never go home. They'll launch an assault.\n\nEven with the fortress's defences however, the garrison, the United Guns  third division, will still have a tough time. The 3rd division is running low on heavy armaments and troops. The attackers, on the other hand, are a rabble of village idiots compared to the highly skilled and trained third division. It will be a close conflict. One person can change the outcome with one moment of bravery or stupidity....\n\nYour train of thought is broken by your squadmate, Gambler.

All normal out here, Over.\"\n\n\n\"Roger that Rachel, good morning to you too and happy hunting. You're due back today, find some quail for me, alright? Feels like months since I last had any, heck, probably has been. North-home - Over\"\n\n\n\"Not making any promises North-home, but I'll try. Rachel Over and Out\"\n\n\nToday marks the fifth and last day of your hunting trip and patrol into the forest south of North home. For five days you've been busy trying to bring back more food for the community, but it hasn't been easy going.\n\n\nThe seasons have been out of whack since everything kept getting hotter in the last two decades, and this year seems to be worse than most. It's a warm June and there's more sunlight in a day this time of year, but no one knows what season it's supposed to be anymore, especially not the wildlife. Over the last few years, animals continually shifted northwards from their ancestral hunting grounds, and their nesting and child rearing cycles went haywire. Now no one can accurately predict what time of year the deer will give birth to their foals, and that's just the deer. At the same time, game has been harder to find this season, you don't know whether it's due to the lack of migratory birds (the few that remained alive after the mess that was the 30s), or something else. Heat waves this far north were unheard of when you were in school. In your college, they became a once a year affair when going out was the worst punishment you could face. Since the last few years it feels like every month has at least one week where the temperature just soars. Maybe that's the cause of all this weather madness, perhaps... Wwwwoof WOOF!\n\n\nA playful bark shakes you out of your gloomy train of thought, quickly followed by another more energetic one. You look down to see your faithful companion, Axe the Russell Terrier merrily bounding around at your feet, happily unconcerned about the food shortage in the valley. \n\n\n\"You're eager to start this morning! You know I envy how easy you have it, no need to worry about food shortages or anything. Hmm, seeing how we're both up already, might as well\"\n\n\nYou unpack some food from your weathered mountain bag as Axe goes into a tizzy at the smell of food. Axe is half the reason you ever took this job. Wardens around North-home were assigned a dog to assist them in their duties of finding food and chasing wanderers away. Axe's enthusiasm has given you a reason to wake up more than once in the past three years you've been buddies, and his constant craving for exercise has had the entirely unintentional effect of keeping you fit, and distracted from everything you've been through.\n\n\nAfter a quick breakfast you pack everything up, while remembering to take out your music player and prevent it from being stuck at the bottom of the pack again. \n\n\nYou head off on your morning patrol with your trusty deputy Axe happily skipping along besides you. As you walk, you keep your eye out for any game, and Axe's with his amazing nose does the same.\n\n\nYou grew up hearing the calls of animals in the woods, but both the calls and the animals are much rarer now. An hour into the walk, and you've heard nothing at all, just happy little Axe barking now and then. Just as you're about to put on some good music to make up for the lack of bird calls, Axe darts off into the distance with an ARF!. It's not his usual bark for people, or for food. By the time you pause your digging into the mountain bag for the music player (the damn thing always finds a way to slip down inside!), Axe has already charged off into the distance. He'll be fine, you muse, there's been nothing unusual in these woods and the most action you've seen on the job is chasing away a crazy survivalist or two every now and then (they're always more trouble than they're worth if you were to guide them to North-home). Still, they have their uses, you were able to trade with one of the more approachable ones for your current solar powered music player, and while it didn't come cheap, you can't put a price on good music.\n\n\nThe player has all of the greats, including the King, the Crickets, and amongst other things even the Backalley Boys.\n", "Listening to the classics": "\"I'm just a hunk-a hunk-a...\"\n\n\nYou catch yourself singing along with the lyrics, it's a good day after all and you can't help but smile. You'll be back at North-home this evening, with a warm, safe bed waiting for you. And in times like these, a warm bed is nothing to joke about.\n\n\nYou take a minute to appreciate how the songs you're listening to were sung by people long passed now, some easily more than fifty years old, with their own lives and challenges, and yet their songs have outlived them. Even today their words put a smile on your face and a twinkle in your eyes. \n\n\nIt's been an hour and Axe still hasn't returned. While his behaviour is slightly unusual, he has been gone for longer and come back before, so you aren't unduly concerned. Overly worrying makes you age faster, you hear, and there's no need for that, you already worry at times that your looks are starting to fade, and you're only nearing thirty-five.\n\n\nAs the current song, a love it or hate it track from the boy wonders, hits its chorus, your eyes light up! You haven't heard this song in so long it's almost criminal! The mood sweeps over you, do you \n", "Dance!": "The music comes over you, and you can't help but shake a leg! Not dancing to this music would be doing it a great disservice, people have died over less. In all honesty your dance would probably be laughed out of most formal venues, though you doubt there are many of those left. Whatever! You gaily prance around and miraculously avoid tripping over the undergrowth while swaying along to the sweet beats of Noon-tripper.\n\n\nAfter a good half an hour of prancing around you finally feel tired, and the temperature has steadily been rising as the sun climbs further in the sky, so it's fairly humid now. You sit down, and take a sip from your thermos. You feel lighter, as if an unseen gray cloud that had been hovering over your head has moved on. But that silly dog still isn't back yet! He missed a good dance, too.\n\n\nAfter lying next to the dead stump of an old tree for a few minutes as you catch your breath, you hear a familiar sound, Arf!\n\n\nAxe has returned, and just in time. He's jumping about merrily, it seems you were indeed worried over nothing, and were able to enjoy a lively morning in the bargain. \n\n\n\"Axe, don't do that again! I almost got worried about you! Then again, you are a good dog, what am I worrying about?\" YIP YIP!\n\n\nAxe barks happily, agreeing with your line of thought. As you bend down to pet him, you notice a strange multicolored patch on the side of his otherwise clean, short fur. It looks metallic, almost, but there's no blood or anything else out of place. You stay your hand in confusion, to which Axe responds with a puzzled look as he tilts his head side wards, as if to say \"What? I don't see anything wrong, pet me!\"\n\n\nStill, you can't shake the feeling that something isn't quite right. You bring your hand back without petting him, and announce \"Alright Axe, you've got some weird goop on you, you're in for a bath! We'll get you one in the stream on the way back\" \n\n\nAxe is puzzled at the lack of petting, but follows your lead as you begin the walk back.\n", "Broken Axe": "The day wears on, and you continue your march northwards. Axe is being unusually quiet, perhaps tired after the events of the morning. After traveling for a few hours, you reach the stream.\n\n\nYou didn't notice it till now, but the distance between you and Axe has increased during the journey, and now he's walking a full ten feet behind your steps. \"Come on Axe boy, time for that bath you deserve.\" 'Aoo, hmrrr' comes the response.\n\n\nYou're shocked to hear Axe whimper quietly in agreement, instead of his usual enthusiasm. Something is really not right, you can feel it. You take a step back, and look at your clearly weary companion again. He isn't breathing as much as rapidly panting, and you're sure it isn't the heat that's behind this. You carefully walk in a circle around Axe keeping your distance, and then you see it. The patch has grown alarmingly since you first noticed it a few hours ago, it's gone from being roughly half an inch wide to covering a good half of his flank, how did you not notice this earlier?!\n\n\nBefore you curse your own inattentiveness, something catches your eye - wait, did that metallic patch just shimmer? You rub your eyes, no, they're working just fine. THERE! It happened it again! The colors are slowly changing as well! Heavens above... this can't be, it's...\n", "A Virus?": "Your first guess is that it's a virus, but that doesn't sound right. From somewhere in your mind, a fact is dragged out unbidden: Ebola, one of the meanest viruses around, takes anywhere from two to twenty-one days before visible signs appear. Even after the first symptoms appear, the infected creature still has at the least six more days, sixteen if their luck holds for that long. \n\n\nYou look back at the faintly glowing mark, and it dawns on you. This isn't a virus, this is something far, far more sinister. Your hair stands on its ends as you recognize what you're looking at, something you'd only heard about once before, and the person who'd said it didn't live long afterwards... \n", "The Devourer": "It's the Devourer, a man-made nanomachine cluster that was originally designed to extract rare metals from electronic waste. The project was hailed as a 'miracle of science,' and was meant to be one of the turning points in our evolution as a species. It would be able to reduce our need for new resources by dramatically increasing our ability to recycle old waste, and in doing so drastically cut down on our carbon footprint. For the first five years, everything went according to plan, and everyone shook hands and patted each other on the back.\n\n\nThen in 2040, the dream was shattered. Despite repeated promises that the Devourer would never interact with biological life forms, one of the maintenance workers at a landfill in New Mexico fell ill. Within six hours his body had been covered in a metallic sheen. In another hour, he was dead, his body's rare minerals extracted and tidily arranged in little hexagons on his chest. The worker had been maintaining one of the Aluminum encased robots which shuttled new waste into the slurry where the Devourer was kept, and somehow enough nano-particles had stuck on to the drone that they lept onto the serviceman during maintenance. The incident was quickly hushed, the kin were told the man had slipped and fallen into an industrial crusher and that there was no body to be claimed.\n\n\nSubsequent inquiries uncovered host of control failures across the dozen sites running the Devourer project, including one case where a nanomachine colony was found growing in the wild, about half a kilometer from the site, and no one had noticed. How do you know this? Kian died for it. \n\n\nNow you notice the telltale signs of Axe's arriving death, his breath is even heavier, coming out in rapid, loud pants. His eyes are pained, and confused. You can see the faint glimmer of his exhalation, carrying millions of nanoparticles in each breath. \n\n\nAs much as it hurts you to admit, you know that your partner doesn't have much time left, and that none of this was his fault. There must be a landfill or a wild colony nearby, and while running around Axe must have accidentally brushed through it.\n\n\nKian had mentioned that the best way to stop a Devourer colony was surround it with fire and burn it. The second way to stop it was only available before a node had started forming - wash away the particles, prevent them from accumulating and forming chains, that once formed would begin reorganizing the structure of the matter. It had been found that running water and other forms of motion diluted the presence of the Devourer below levels at which it could reproduce. Axe didn't have that option.\n\n\nYou knew what you had to do, and it horrified you. It was not the farewell Axe deserved, it was outrageous, it was wretched, it was perverse, it was just... wrong! So very, very wrong! But as your eyes met, you think you saw a plea for mercy for release. You put on your field gloves, and quickly built a small fire. You petted Axe one last time, and as you closed his eyes, you think he understood. You said a few words that would mean nothing to Axe or alleviate his pains, but would give you a small token of closure.\n\n\n\"Axe, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I'm helpless, there's nothing I can do. We've spent so many great times together, and you were what kept me going, despite being broken inside. When I was scared you were by my side, when I was happy you joined in my happiness. I'm losing another one of my loved ones today, I hope I won't lose anyone again. I can't keep going through...\" Your voice trails off into sobs as you try to drown out the shrieks, but you know in your heart that you'll be hearing them again in your sleep in the years to come. Today you've added one more nightmare to your sick collection. \n\n\nYou feel mentally and emotionally exhausted, and realize it's only been around fifteen minutes since you stopped for a break. However, you know your ordeal is far from over. \n", "Wait": "While you are on the edge from the disastrous turn of events, you manage to keep your cool. Running to the colony without thinking this through will only frighten them and doubt your sanity, and you're one of the very few people alive who knows anything useful about the Devourer. Worse, having been near Axe for the past few hours, you could end up bringing back enough nano-machines that a self-replicating node could form at North-home, and within a few hours the settlement could be lost.\n\n\nThankfully, you haven't seen any nodes form on your person. Washing the particles on you remains an option for now to control further spread of the nanites. Still, to be cautious you should leave the gloves you handled Axe with behind, better yet burn them.\n\n\n \n", "Burn your gloves, radio home, and return": "You think that should be enough precaution to prevent the Devourer from spreading to North-Home. You radio ahead of your arrival, and calmly ask for a meeting with the Council at the earliest opportunity. During the journey there's no playful dog at your side, you hear no birds, only the slow and heavy steps of your own feet. The loss that you were ignoring weighs heavily on your mind and hounds your steps. Your mind overflows with thoughts of sadness and sorrow, and the settlement feels miles away.\n\n\nYou try to calm yourself, repeating that what happened wasn't your fault. The rational side of you knows this and agrees, the other side unfortunately does not. Slowly, you continue your lonely walk, reaching a little over an hour and a half since the stream.\n", "An uncomfortable choice": "You come to terms with the fact that your clothes and gear may well be contaminated by now. Your best bet is to burn them (which will have been exposed to the largest quantity of nanites), and throw the remaining items into the stream - the moving water should effectively dilute the nanites into being unable to reform as a node. \n\n\nYou think that should be enough precaution to prevent the Devourer from spreading to North-Home. You radio ahead of your arrival, and calmly ask for a meeting with the Council at the earliest opportunity. You also announce that you'll be walking in in the buff, and that the guards should be prepared to be surprised by your arrival. \n\n\nWhile disrobing, your hand comes across something at your neck that you'd worn for so long you'd forgotten it was still there. A pendant in the shape of a silver cross, it was handed down to you by your mother, and to her by her mother, and stayed in the family for more than a hundred years now. It's a small thing, and one of your last memories of your past. For some reason, deciding the fate of this small cross makes you more uncomfortable than the fact that you're standing in the buff in the middle of the forest. You decide to\n", "Background: How the Devourer replicates": "The DEVR-R was modeled after insect colonies in its organization. There are two arrangements of DEVR-R particles: Drones, and Nodes.\n\n\nDrones are the individual droplets that make up the ocean, each with minuscule processing power, solar cells, and memory. When they gather in swarms however, they are able to rely on each other, and even store energy amongst them to allow light work through the night (where they otherwise would have been dormant). The drones stretch out to cover whatever material they are placed into like a shroud. Within their shroud, they pick up and move elements through little conveyer belts made of drones, by drones. Dangerous elements such as Mercury are enclosed within walls made of 'dead' nanites and are continually replaced. A binary number is indented next to the extracted element, allowing ease of identification to human extractors. Drones swarms were designed to be heavier than air at the aggregate level, however they are also able to reconfigure into small catapults that fling millions of drones around three inches away (affected by the wind at the moment), so the swarm can reach areas otherwise just slightly out of reach.\n\n\nNodes are a cluster of billions of billions of drones, arranged in an assembly line, with usable parts being shipped in by threads of drones connected to the node. By design, a node can produce enough nanite to assemble six separate new nodes if the conditions are favorable. Realistically, most nanites are lost trying to subdue highly acidic or basic chemicals by throwing themselves at them in waves to dilute them with their own matter, so only two to three new nodes are made on an average. A node is a little less than half a cubic inch large, and produces its capacity of nanites within a few hours depending on environmental conditions.\n\n\nIn both cases, the drones were not supposed to be capable of existing outside of the range of control signals sent out by a host station. Those control signals, along with limitations on the number of times a node can replicate were intended to be adequate safeguards to prevent the spread of the DEVR-R outside of laboratories. Clearly, those safeguards weren't enough.\n"}, "tree": {"The Story of the Devourer": {"Begin the story": {"You sit back, relax, and enjoy the classics.

Brulok was now standing, his animated shadow silhouetted on the trees behind the fire. Their arguing had been going on for some time, but you had barely paid attention. Ella was gone. Kunchku was gone. Deleh was gone. Nhandah was gone. The Ghost People stole them in the night, along with so many others, and now your people were desperate and forlorn, having been driven out from the Mother caves and into the freezing forest. Even the remaining young children, naked and covered in animal fat to keep them warm, seemed too somber to play as they always had before.\n\"Brulok,\" countered Thekko, the beads in his long, braided beard shimmering in the soft light as he spoke. \"How can we get them back? We know only that the Ghost People went South, and by now the trail has no life in it, murdered by the snow. And even if we could find them, how do we defeat them? They are so many, and their magic is strong.\" He glanced dismissively at Brulok before bringing his eyes back to the wooden spear he was sharpening. \"You must end this folly, Brulok. Let them die.\" Brulok stepped menacingly toward Thekko. \"They have my Luna! My girl-child! I will go after them, and I will find them and die. But you? You will live.\" He lowered his voice. \"You will live as your father before you, Thekko: a coward.\"\nInstantly Thekko was on his feet, spear raised. \"Coward? I will show you how a coward kills, Brulok, and then you will join your girl-child where she already is: the River of Ghosts!\" Brulok jumped back away from the fire, then raised his spear to meet Thekko's. Loud wooden clacks filled the air as the others around the fire stood and retreated backward. As Thekko charged again, Brulok hooked his own spear underneath Thekko's, then pivited, sending him crashing to the snow.\nHe rose slowly, wiping blood from his mouth, his eyes fixed on Brulok and filled with hatred. \"Your father deserved his death, Brulok. He was a fool, and my father was right to let him die.\" Brulok's face reddened with rage, and the two rushed at each other, spears pointed at eachother's heart.\n\"Enough.\" The voice was soft and frail, but instantly the enraged men froze in their tracks. Grandmother Naetah stood near the edge of the group, leaning on her ornamental staff, looking as ancient as Sister Moon. \"The People of the River are One.\" Brulok opened his mouth to protest, but a sharp glance from the tiny woman silenced him. \"The People of the River are One,\" she said again. Closing her eyes, she raised her hand toward the fire and an expectant hush fell over the group.\n\"The First Fire has spoken to me in a vision,\" she spoke. \"He declares that the People of the River shall be made One again.\" She turned her head and looked directly at you. \"The First Man shall find them, and,\" her voice lowered to a whisper, \"he shall find another.\" Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head and she collapsed to the floor, and all those around, including Brulok and Thekko, rushed to her aid. Her breath was labored, her skin pale. Making eye contact with you, she urgently took your hand. Her grasp was freezing, smothering your heat like an icy wind to a single spark. She closed her eyes and said, \"Leave us, all of you. All of you but Ashkii.\" Confused, the others rose, while Grandmother Naetah clinged fiercely to your hand.\n", "The Chosen Path": "\"Ashkii,\" she said, her eyes wandering aimlessly up at the sky, \"you will make the People of the River whole again.\" Her eyes closed for a moment as she struggled to find the air to speak. \"When the Ghost People came, when they took our children and killed our fires, the First Fire in my hut survived.\" You were perplexed at this, for you already knew the First Fire still lived. Had the First Fire been murdered, there would not be a fire for the People as there was this night. \"Grandmother, what do you mean?\" She reached for your face. \"Ashkii, my child, the First Fire sustained itself on your totem. I used it to again light the flame we took from the cave, but it was your totem which saved it.\"\nYour wooden totem? Each new child is made one to represent their life and health when they are born, and Grandmother Naetah was the one who watched over them in her hut, protecting their spirits. Yours saved the First Fire? \"But Grandmother, I am still weak, having only seen eight winters. How can the First Fire have chosen me to make the People of the River whole again?\" Her answer was surprisingly strong and desperate. \"No. You are nearly a man grown, Ashkii. Tell me, what does your name mean?\" You knew this. It meant 'man' in the old tongue of the southern grasses. Still, you were confused and waited patiently for her to explain. \"You are the First Man I saw in my vision,\" she said. \"You are the one to lead The People of the River into the new age.\"\nBarely audible now, Grandmother Naetah seemed to collapse into herself as she whispered to you. \"Ashkii, your totem was chosen, and it will lead you. Head south, and make our people One again.\" An alarming sound escaped her mouth before she spoke once more. \"The First Fire cannot lie, Ashkii. Save them.\" Grandmother Naetah spoke no more after that, her breath and spirit returning to the River of Ghosts as you held her dying body.\n", "Blessing": "The next morning you sat waiting inside Mother Ainu's hut. She had yet to eat the eyes of Grandmother Naetah and make the transformation into the new Seer, but still she was venerated as the successor. Having lived through thirty-nine winters, her head and body hair had already turned grey, and although she wasn't nearly as ancient as Grandmother Naetah had been, her powers were strong.\nOpening her eyes, she finally spoke. \"You must heed what Grandmother Naetah commanded you,\" she said. \"And you must go alone.\" You started to protest, but Mother Ainu stoped you with a hand to the chest. \"Remember what happened with Thekko's and Burlok's fathers. Thekkon chose not to pull Arlok from the path of Grandfather Mammoth and his kin, thinking he was saving the people by not risking more wrath from the beasts, yet when he returned the People hated him for it. There was a fight that took many.\" You blinked at this. You had never heard this part of the story, only that there was a rivalry between Thekko's and Burlok's fathers, and that Arlok was either brave or foolish to try to salvage the People's kill despite the approaching angry mammoth family.\n\"But there is more,\" Mother Ainu continued. \"Your affliction may prove advantageous, but only if no other of the People are with you.\" She was referring to your small amount of hair. Even at your adolescent age of eight winters, you had far too little hair for one of the People of the River. \"This may allow you to get close to the Ghost People, for they, too, are nearly naked, much like our children.\" You felt awkward and ashamed at this, being compared to the enemy this way. \"I did not choose to be this way, Mother Ainu!\" Tears began to form in your eyes as you remembered the ridicule the other children gave you just two winters ago. Even today the People looked at you suspiciously.\nMother Ainu smiled. \"None can choose their fate, Ashkii. It has been hard for you always being alone, but like Long Tooth, the clever cat who lives a life of solitude yet is able to bring down the mighty muskox, your loneliness has made you strong and patient. You will need your strength, but it may be you will need your patience more, should you speak with the Ghost People.\" You gasped aloud at that. \"Speak with them?\" you asked. Mother Ainu noded. \"Yes. You may not be able to steal away our brothers and sisters, Ashkii. You may need other means to save them. I will give you our tribe's greatest blessing, and if stealth should fail you, try to make an exchange for our children.\"\nShe brought you in close and kissed your forehead. \"Now go,\" she said. \"Head down the mountain and to the grasses, where the Ghost People dwell. Let your spirit guide you, and keep your totem close.\n\"And remember, Ashkii,\" she added, \"without the thick hair that most of the People of the River have, you will need to keep a piece of the First Fire alive to stay warm at night in the colder places. For if the fire goes out, you will have no choice but to do the forbidden and wear the skin of another hunter.\" She handed you a thick branch and bag of animal fat to keep the fire burning, and then closed her eyes and resumed her meditation. You lowered your head in respect and then left the hut.\nGathering your supplies, you considered which direction you would go. You knew the Ghost People lived in the grasses to the south, but directly South lies the tall grass where Sharp Beak lives. Over twice as tall as a the tallest member of your tribe, with talons as long as a forearm, Sharp Beak was a fearsome foe alone, and he hunted like the People of the River, as One with his brothers. The path just off the mountain was fraught with risk. Another option was to climb over the adjacent mountain to the East and the head around the tall grass before resuming the trek toward where the Ghost People lived. However, up so high for so long was dangerous. It was much colder, and without the thick hair of your kinsmen, freezing to death was a possibility if you lost your fire.\nJust as you reached the edge of the encampment, you paused. The prey instinct of one being stalked overwhelmed your senses for a moment, and you listened to hear if you were being followed. After a moment of calm and quiet, you shook your head and relaxed, your worry slipping away with the deep breath you had been holding. Taking one final glance at your new home, you adjusted your sack of supplies and began the long journey.\n", "Head directly South, toward the tall grass": "The journey was long, but eventually you got to the valley floor where the tall grass grew. Your fire still burned, although you needed to switch branches several times to keep the flame alive, and your stomach was full. You foraged off of berries when you got below the timberline, but it was a dead muskox you found near the base of the mountain that satiated you. Unfortunately, you had to leave the carcass behind. Had others been with you, more of the beast could have been carried. Wastefulness was not the way of the People of the River, but time was of the essence.\nWhen you finally reached the tall grasses, you were forced to use your cape to shield your firestick from the blades of grass, to avoid starting an uncontrollable fire. It was extremely hot, but you knew you'd need the fire again if you were to make it back to the mountain in which your people lived. When you reached a clearing, you slowly came to the realization that all the ambient wildlife sound was gone.\nWith the need to cover the fire without smothering it or burning yourself, your concentration on your surroundings waned. When you opened your cape and let your firestick breathe the free air, the only sound you could here was the rustling of the wind through the tall poles of grass. This was a sign of a predator stalking in the nearby grass. Instantly you ducked down, carefully setting your burning stick on the ground.\nTilting your head with spear raised, you listened intently. A sudden movement to your right in the corner of your eye made you turn your head, but you knew Sharp Beak's clever ways, and quickly turned your head back around. That was when you saw him: tall, much taller than you, he glared at you through the grass with empty longing, his sharp yellow beak peaking down from above. You heard his brothers running in the distance behind you.\nRealizing that his plan to attack you from behind had failed, Sharp Beak charged, his powerful, long legs churning, his massive talons digging up grass and dirt. Knowing Sharp Beak's brothers are scattered about behind you, if you stood and fought your kill would have to be swift, lest one of them take you from behind. You could also run and then hide in the grasses. In a clearing you would have no hope of escaping Sharp Beak and his brothers, but with this tall grass you may be able to escape.\n\nTo attempt to throw your spear immediately, use the Spear in \"My Inventory\" below\n", "Try to escape through the tall grass, keeping your fire burning": "Knowing you could never defeat a pack of the creatures, you ran from Sharp Beak. You dashed through the tall grass, turning this way and that, trying to outmaneuver your pursuer.\nUnfortunately, while outrunning one terror bird was not unheard of, outrunning a pack of them was quite impossible. Just as you turned your head behind you to see if the animal was getting close, a large body rammed into your chest, smashing you to the ground. Scrambling back, you realize you dropped your firestick. As Sharp Beak approached, suddenly the grass between the two of you caught fire. The animal reared up, and you were spared his talons. Not wasting any time, you ran away from the creature.\nThe fire spread quickly, and soon all avenues of approach from the pack of maneaters was aflame. Through the flames you could see angry Sharp Beaks watching in frustration before they began to turn away from the conflagration one by one.\nAfter several minutes you finally caught your breath, and, checking to make sure your totem was secure, you began a brisk walk away from the fire, toward where you know the Ghost People dwell. Days later you will realize that you forgot to gather another firestick, and will wonder if you have doomed your people.\n", "Chapter 2": "The distant white mountains brightly reflected the light from the midday sun. Shadows from clouds decorated the green vista before you with dark lakes of shadow, interrupted periodically by bright white light bouncing off of birds flying through. Taking one last glance back toward your home, you adjusted your rucksack and carried on through the low grasses.\nYou knew the Ghost People were somewhere in this valley, most likely among the forest near the horizon. You'd never seen trees like those; short, wide, bright green leaves, and odd, twisted branches. The trees where your people live are tall and dark, with sharp needles. The way these trees gently swayed in the wind gave a very peaceful feeling.\nHours passed as you followed a stream through the valley. Signs of life were everywhere, but no predators could be seen. Still, you kept low and near cover whenever you could find it. Eventually you had to slow down as you began passing through the forest; with your vision impeded, you had to depend more on your other senses and moving quickly made too much noise, interfering with your hearing.\nAs the sunlight began to wane you heard the sound of a girl. She was crying, a soft sound in the distance. As quietly as you could you crept into the bushes and waited. She was being led from behind by a tall, well built man covered from head to toe in white paint. These two were of the Ghost People. The man held tightly to her hair, and she grasped his wrist with both her hands to try to relieve her obvious pain. She whimpered something to him, and then he shouted at her in a strange language before hitting her on the head.\nShe looked to be about six or seven by the measure of your own people, a girl on the verge of womenhood. The smell of her blood confirmed her blossoming appearance. You then realized the significance of what you saw: this man meant to mate with her against her will. This was absolutely forbidden, for successful childbirth and rearing of children to adulthood were far too difficult to risk injury to a woman through violence.\nThe man roughly threw her to her knees and began to remove his garments. The girl looked back at him pleadingly, saying something you couldn't understand, and he responded with a vicious kick to her side. The girl lay in tears and out of breath on the dirt as the man knelt behind her and began to tear away her clothes. Searing anger filled your mind. This was wrong, and no proud family member of the People of the River would let something like this happen. Still, you had your own people to find, and you knew that should you fall, they would be lost forever.\n", "Don't get involved": "You felt bad for the girl, but this wasn't your fight. You hid in the bushes, trying your best not to listen to the girls cries as the man raped her. You hated yourself as you sat there, knowing how violent he was being. Not once did he let go of her hair, and you heard numerous smacks of flesh on flesh as he repeatedly hit the girl. What kind of man are you, you wondered repeatedly. Still, soon it was over, and the man fell back in heaving breaths.\nYou contented yourself to wait until both of them were long gone, and tried to clear your mind of the filth you felt with yourself when you suddenly heard a wail from the girl followed by a wet smack. You turned to see the girl standing over the rapist, a large rock covered in blood in her hands. She brought the rock down again on the man, smashing his face. Over and over she slammed the rock into him, and soon it was clear he was dead. You silently applauded the girl for refusing to give up and choosing to endure until the man was distracted, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\nShe sat motionless by the stream for a while, still unaware of your presence. Eventually she ambled off. You weren't really sure what this incident meant. It was clear that the young woman and the man were not of the same tribe, even if they were of the same people. Weighing your options, you decided to follow the girl, hoping she would lead you to more of the Ghost People, and possibly to your lost brothers and sisters. All of your concentration was bent to the task of remaining invisible to her. Every time she turned around you vanished into the bushes without making a sound. So intently did you focus on your prey, you lost track of the dangers of other hunters.\nWith no warning you were suddenly knocked to the ground. All you saw was spotted fur and teeth. The animal felt heavy, some one hundred and fifty pounds, and it had grasped deeply into your shoulder with its jaws, its claws digging deeply into your side. In the heat of the moment you noticed it was a large cat with thin, spotted fur. You wrestled with it through the dirt, using your considerable strength to hold it by the neck and prevent it from tearing out your throat, but its back legs were doing serious damage to your side.\nSuddenly the animal reared up and tried to look back. In the corner of your eye you could see the girl you were following had stabbed the animal with a long, sharp knife. Not wasting the opportunity, you smothered the cat in a bear hug, trying to choke the life out of it while the girl repeatedly stabbed it. Eventually the creature was still, and covered in your own blood, you collapsed onto your back.\n", "Try to save her": "You couldn't just stand by and let this happen. This was wrong, and you weren't about to stand idly by. With as loud a voice as you could muster, you leapt from the bushes and ran toward the man. Startled, he fell to the ground, and you quickly bowled over him. Your initial advantage of surprise served you well, as you were able to gain position on top of him, but the man was clearly an experienced fighter and was able to use leverage to flip you over. The two of you stood and squared each other up. The man, a look of fury upon his face, uttered something unintelligible in a low voice before launching toward you.\nAgain the two of you tumbled to the ground, and the wrestling match continued. Each of you sought to strangle the other, and early on it was clear you were significantly stronger. Soon the man's grip began to weaken, and his face turned dark red. You were sure of your impending victory, squeezing with everything you had, when suddenly you felt a strange, dull pain in your side. Squeezing harder, you tried to ignore it, but again you felt the pain. You looked down and saw the man repeatedly stabbing you with the thinnest knife you had ever seen. Your grip began to weaken, and soon the man had you pinned to the ground.\nAs he raised the blade high for a killing stroke, he suddenly lurched forward. He turned behind him, looking at the girl you both had forgotten about, standing behind him holding a large rock. Again she smashed the man, this time squarely in the face. He fell on top of you, his waist landing on your face, and you heard quick footsteps as the girl quickly ran around and began to crush the man to death.\nOut of breath, and knowing the initial threat was now passed, you allowed yourself to collapse onto your back into gentle oblivion.\n", "Awakening": "The first thing you noticed was the smell of flowers. The sunlight penetrated your closed eyelids, and you gently swayed in and out of awareness. A sound disturbed your peace. Ignoring the distraction, you concentrated on how the gentle warm breeze felt against your skin, content to float on the edge of consciousness.\nAgain the sound, this time accompanied by a gentle shake on your shoulder. You opened your eyes to a beautiful vision; a dark golden skinned girl with brown eyes silhouetted by the sun, her featured soft and full, staring at down at you. It was clearly an impossible dream. She spoke, and you had no idea what she said, but you know the sound pleased you. Again the words, and slowly you began to remember.\nShe was the girl from the Ghost People, and you were still gravely injured. Suddenly the pain came back in full force, and you wretched. The girl placed a hand on your arm, and you noticed she had covered your wounds in some sort of plant. Gently the girl took you by the back of the neck and held a sack to your lips. Out from it water flowed, and you drank greedily. Behind her you noticed a fire burning. You gestured toward it, wondering where she got the flames from. She looked toward the fire and then backed to you and merely shrugged, clearly not understanding the significance of your question. She gently laid you down and again tried to speak to you, but you could understand nothing of what she said. Your eyes beginning to get heavy, you slipped back into unconsciousness.\nTime passed, and again you found yourself in her arms as she offered you water. Behind her you could see she was cooking a large cat. The smell of its flesh stirred your long dormant hunger and your stomach growled loudly. The girl laughed at that, a high, mirthful piercing of silence that made you smile despite your pain. She reached for the animal and sliced off a piece. As she handed it to you, she said something that sounded very similar to one of your own words, from the ancient language of the plains: Long Tooth, the mighty cat of the mountains. Curious, you took the meat and chewed contemplatively.\nLooking you in the eyes, she placed her hand on her chest and said, \"Wenonah.\" You knew that word! It was from the old language. It meant first daughter. That was her name. You placed your own hand on your chest and gave her your own name. \"Ashkii,\" she repeated, letting the word roll around in her mouth. Waving her hand back and forth between the two of you, she said, \"Wenonah a Ashkii.\" She smiled and sat down beside you, bringing the skin of water back to your lips.\nFor hours the two of you spoke without understanding each other, your pain forgotten in the beauty of her smile and laughter. Several words she said sounded vaguely familiar to you, but for the most part it was nonsense. More important than the words was the conversation itself. For now, near the fire, the two of you were safe, and that was all the mattered. Long after sunset, as you began to drift away, Wenonah slid down beside you on the ground, her arm gently resting across your chest.\n", "Recovering": "Weeks passed before you were able to get up and move for more than a few moments. Wenonah was able to provide food for the two of you using a spear you made for her, and clever traps which caught rodents. Your days were spent helping around the camp site and making tools, but your nights were spent around the fires each night with Wenonah. These nights had become special to you. Day by day you were better able to communicate, and soon she was able to teach to you her secret of making fire. At first you were shocked and slightly disturbed by her ability to summon the First Fire so easily, but after a day or two you realized two things: first, this magic would help the People of the River become more powerful than ever before, and second, this frail looking girl was slowly sneaking her way into your heart.\nShe was beautiful in a strange, alien way. Her body was much more lithe than the sisters of the People of the River, and her eyes were smaller. Her jawline was smaller too, more graceful, but her chin was more regal looking. And above all, her skin was nearly naked and smooth. Smooth and dark golden-brown. The women of your people weren't as hairy as the men, but in some places they were certainly hairier than this girl. It was strange, and maybe a bit related to the odd condition of your own lightly coated body, but her smoothness only accentuated her beauty.\nShe, too, seemed somewhat taken with you. Each afternoon she would laugh and speak with you, and each night she slipped into your arms to sleep. Each day you learned more of her language, which was tightly connected to the Old Tongue, which you knew from childhood, and each halting conversation with her brought the two of you closer together. One night, feeling especially fond of her, you asked her, \"Wenonah, how many winters have you seen?\" You were hoping she was old enough to be your woman, but she only looked about six or seven, which would make her a couple years too young. \"Fourteen,\" she replied, and you could sense she understood why you asked. You were shocked. How could she be so much older than you but look two years younger than you? Perhaps her people aged at a different rate? Still, the answer pleased you. No matter your people's rules regarding finding a mate among another People, at least you knew she was old enough according to your people's customs.\nGathering your courage, you said, \"Wenonah, are you old enough by your people's custom to choose a man?\" She merely nodded and reached for your face. Her eyes twinkling in the fire light, you pulled her close and kissed her.\n"}, "tree": {"The People of the River": {"The Chosen Path": {"Blessing": {"Head directly South, toward the tall grass and the domain of Sharp Beak": {"Try to escape through the tall grass, keeping your fire burning": {"Chapter 2": {"Don't get involved": {"Waking up": "END"}}}, "Try to save her": {"Awakening": {"Recovering": {"The People": "END"}}}}, "Try to save her": "END"}}}}}, {"title": "The Last Man Standing", "stories": {"PLAY!!!": "Huh?\n\n\nAlright, fine.

Looking over the orders that sent you here.\n\n\n\n\"Dear Lord Butterfield,\n\nThe High Lords of Earth have given you charge of sector [1J7E] with your new responsibilities to build up the local infrastructure, arbitration of Terran law, and local defense. Your new charge has been designated as sub-standard in infrastructure, has a high level of criminality, and is a high threat area.\n\n\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiriam Hirum\n\nSecretary to the secretary of the High Lords of Terra\"\n\n\n\nIn plain speech it means that the group of Planets, and planetoids you've been given charge over mostly consists of wild cat miners, people that have lived outside of the Empires jurisdiction for generations, are by and large used to going without and don't mind it for the most part, and are in danger of getting absolutely destroyed by whatever alien forces might happen to take interest in the area.\n\n\n\nRight now you have a full battle cruiser that just finished scanning the area and there are three options you have available depending on which part of your duties you want to complete first.\n\n\n\nFor infrastructure, you can just have the engineers build an H3 refinery station on the nearest Gas giant. It will provide enough fuel in the area and some work as well for the locals that are willing to bring in more people from out of the system that aren't just long-haul wildcats or freedom lovers. From there you might be able to get some general commerce in the area that you can try to organize from there. \n\n\n\nYou can try to start by implementing the law. There are a few habitable planets nearby that you can set up Marine posts on. From there you can strike out at local warlords and support them from the cruiser.\n\n\n\nThe last option would be to build a battle station in the system. It would be the best option for defense, but it would be more of a speed bump for any force trying to push into human space and would give you a place to rearm and refuel a larger force from.\n", "Build an H3 Refinery": "A year passes with you spending most of your days aboard the Cruiser. You watch bit by bit as a refinery comes together in the orbit of the Largest gas giant in the system. A long tendril reaches down from the refinery into the atmosphere that pumps lighter gases up to be processed for various industrial uses.\n\n\n\nAn unexpected side effect is a decent-sized market has been put together in the refinery and a lot of locals come by for trade.\n\n\n\nOne of the local warlords has actually offered to become an Auxilia military force for supply, a fair pay rate, and a bit of training.\n\n\n\nYou could take them up on the offer or try to draw in a smaller number of proper Imperial military.\n", "Hire the locals as part of the Auxilia": "You hire the local warlord as an Auxilia unit. They are trained up and disciplined by the various military components they are equivalent to. Marines train the warriors, pilots their pilots, things of that nature. They aren't of the same quality that a properly trained force would have, but they're local and don't require the same supply train a good force would take. There are some discipline issues and the executions, and imprisonment used to keep them in line are not popular. You find that the more lax officers you send to keep the Auxilia in line have a better survival rate than the more strict ones.\n\n\n\nAnother year passes and various skirmishes between your new forces and any warbands that resent the new growing Imperial presence that mostly consists of settlers. The Auxilia unit grows as other warbands join for the pay, supply, and training. Even though you haven't focused on the law in the sector it has improved drastically in the past two years. A greater portion of the wildcat miners and refiners have started registering their craft and plants under Imperial law to gain the protection of the Imperial affiliated forces. As have a greater number of well-established communities.\n", "An unexpected attack": "Waking one day you find a new report a Xenos fleet has arrived in system. These creatures are a wandering people that strip the sectors they pass through of everything they can. They respect no boundaries set by other peoples, they respect no property laws but their own, and they respect no life but their own. They do not negotiate, they only take what they want.\n\n\n\nWar has come to [1J7E]. You remain abord the cruiser for this war. The captain of the Cruiser hides in asteroid fields and various gravity wells to strike out at the enemy fleet. You remain out of contact with most of the Auxilia for the greater portion of the war. You wait out most of the war not fully understanding what's going on around you.\n", "Epilogue: A new Loyal Imperial system [1J7E]": "The war comes to an end and you find out what happened. The Captain of your Cruiser did a decent amount of damage to the supply ships and even some of the ships that held the general population of your enemy. This forced your enemy to pull forces from their frontline, opening them up to attack by the Auxilia. The Auxilia managed to hold the frontline long enough for most of the colonies to start evacuating. By the time the enemy pushed through to the first colonies what they found was mostly traps and the belligerently well-armed.\n\n\n\nEnough imperial refugees fled the system that you received a proper Imperial fleet to drive off the enemy. The enemy was scattered because they were hunting down the cruiser or the Auxilia or happened to be a part of some mobile refinery. The Imperial fleet shattered any resistance and drove the enemy from the system. To your knowledge, the Imperial fleet is still giving chase to the shattered remains of the enemy three systems away now.\n\n\n\nFor now, your job is back to arranging the return of the colonists and the medals and awards for the forces that fought for this system, both from the proper Military and from the honored Auxilia. Four out of five of the awards you sign off on are posthumous. You have a lifetime to make the system something better for the families of those that died for the Empire. Whether they realized that's what they were doing or not.\n\n\n\nThose that return have a greater respect and love of you as their MarchWarden and for the Empire as a whole.\n", "Use your money to bring in proper Imperial forces": "There would be discipline issues if you brought in Auxilia units. You spend your money on proper troops to enforce the law in your area. Another Cruiser with a Marine and fighter components arrive. This gives you better control over a larger area that you can enforce Imperial rule in.\n\n\n\nMore and more Imperial citizenry begin moving into the area. The second cruiser gives you a better ability to enforce the law in areas that Imperial citizenry settle. Bit by bit you start taking over the system from the locals. Various locals have the terrible idea that they can treat Imperial citizenry can be treated just like any of the other shlubs in the system. Fighters are sent on bombing runs, marines are deployed for recovery operations. Soon the imperial citizenry find that there's open lands and claims that used to belong to raider groups. \n\n\n\nYou estimate that the local population has dropped to about half of what it was when you arrived. The greater portion of that is due to several groups just leaving the system. Although you do admit that some of it is because of how many of the locals made ends meet through piracy and raiding, and needed to be brought to heel because of it.\n", "An expected attack": "Waking one day you find a new report a Xenos fleet is coming to the system. These creatures are a wandering people that strip the sectors they pass through of everything they can. They respect no boundaries set by other peoples, they respect no property laws but their own, and they respect no life but their own. They do not negotiate, they only take what they want.\n\n\n\nWar is coming to [1J7E] so you begin preparations as such. You begin an evacuation of the system of both Imperial Citizenry and the locals alike. You don't bother forcing people to leave, it's not worth the effort. What you do provide is a warning and evacuation points. Also you bring in various smart weapons and another flight of fighter bombers.\n\n\n\nYou lead this war from the Capital ship you arrived in the system with. You don't direct military matters. You have specialists that have dedicated their lives to that craft. What you do is sign off on operations and requests for war supplies or reinforcements. The war ends in a few weeks.\n\n\n\nThe enemy didn't know what hit them. Their main forces moved directly to your two cruisers guiding themselves right through the inactive smart weapons. Ordering them activated you watch as the enemy fleet is torn apart by torpedos, plasma bombs, short magazine automated rail weapons, and more. The two cruisers and various fighter bomber groups tear apart their manufactory and refining fleet. Very few of the enemy are taken alive, this is mostly due to the enemy having no concept of surrender. None of the enemy escape.\n", "Epilogue: Intel from the enemy": "The enemy that you capture isn't because they surrender. You manage to get a hold of two enemy vessels through luck. One vessel because the command module and the backup were both destroyed leaving the vessel with no guidance. The other because the engines were destroyed. The Naval forces under your command manage to recover as many of the enemy as possible from wreckage and lifeboats. They're put in a few work camps on planet, mostly enough to make their own furniture and food while you decide what to do with a surprisingly humanoid species. Various scientific specialists observe them and slowly start finding out what they require and how they communicate.\n\n\n\nThe locals that return or never left by and large integrate into Imperial society. The ones that don't become someone else's problem in some other system. \n\n\n\nYears later you find out that the invading aliens have been fleeing an enemy that has been chasing them for generations. These newcomers gradually integrate into human society although they require slightly different protein structures to survive.\n", "Set up Planetary Marine Outposts": "Marines are sent to the most habitable planet to the local star. The local warlords are demolished as the Marines take over the various holdings with close air support and the occasional orbital strike from the cruiser. The world is yours inside of a few months. The biggest issue is that you lack occupational troops for this. The Marines are the best Humanity has to offer, but there's just not enough of them to enforce the law on this planet. The rest of your money goes into bringing in supply and house troops to occupy the planet as an insurgency moves against you. You own the sky of this planet though. Not very much beyond it though.\n\n\n\nA year passes as the skirmishing below continues. Your forces have begun training a decent force out of the locals to fight the system warlords. As another year passes you manage to suppress any outright opposition against the Empire even though the infrastructure you're supposed to be building suffers for it. All your money is tied up in suppressing the insurgency. \n", "Another force enters the brawl": "Waking one day you find a new report a Xenos fleet has arrived in system.

They respect no boundaries set by other peoples, they respect no property laws but their own, and they respect no life but their own. They do not negotiate, they only take what they want.\n\n\nThe insurgency goes quiet the day after the fleet arrives and you take a shuttle down planetside. Reports come in to tell you that the locals had built up a fleet in secret to fight you. The only reason you know this is that they unleash it upon the invaders doing a significant amount of damage to the enemy fleet. The Cruiser that has been your home for the past two years goes down in flame.\n\n\n\nYou manage to evacuate before the enemy bombards the city. They avoid damaging industrial areas or agricultural ones. The house troops, and locals do extensive damage to any invading forces that attempt that before retreating. The Marines don't retreat. If there's anything worth taking from a factory that's defended by Marines after a fight the enemy needs to move a thousand bodies to clear a path to take it. Eventually, the enemy just leaves. You don't know if it's because they've taken enough loot or they finally just decided it wasn't worth the losses for what they were getting.\n", "Epilogue: An Execution": "There's not enough Marines left to protect you. The house guard has had such extensive casualties and gone through so much ammunition that there's not enough of them in fighting condition with enough functioning gear to come save you. The locals you've recruited are better than the local insurgents. More civilized for certain. Which is why you're getting executed instead of just torn apart in the streets.\n\n\n\nYou get to choose your final meal. They limit you to one course though and tell you what the options are. They aren't much, but the Parmesan Chicken Imperial ration isn't terrible. You could certainly do better for a last meal, but it isn't the worst they could do to you.\n\n\n\nYou see the locals that you had trained up stand in a neat firing line just before you are blindfolded. \n", "Build a Fully Operational Battle Station": "It takes a year to build. You add a third of the population of the system to the system with this project from the maintenance crew to the supply chain, and from the fighter pilots to the gun crews. You cut back on your own personal luxuries to build this station and lived like a common crewman for a year. It's all worth it though as you step aboard the completed station and christen it \"The Butterfield\".\n\n\n\nThis battle station has given you complete control of the system. If someone wants to fly through space here they do so under your guns. Imperial citizens of various interests have made this system their home and it only takes one example to show the locals what happens if a citizen of the empire is attacked.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the local warlords offer to work for you after that example is made. They see the way the wind is blowing and want to be on the winning side. Having troops to settle things planetside would be handy seeing as almost all of your power is naval.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, you have an overwhelming amount of military power already so maybe you should start building up some infrastructure so you don't need to ship everything you need for the battle station in from outside the system.\n", "Hire the local warlords on as Auxilia": "Hiring the local fighters on as Auxilia is a no-brainer. You give them uniforms, regular pay, Imperial medical treatment, and proper training from the Marines and suddenly you have low discipline house troops. They're immediately deployed to almost always their local zones of influence and they start sending you taxes.\n\n\n\nIt's still a dent in your house's money. The drain on your accounts eases up over the next year as various entrepreneurs pop up from both the locals and the influx of Imperial Citizenry that set up local provisioners, factories, and refineries that slowly ease away the prices of transportation from out of system you're paying.\n", "An unwelcome guest arrives expecting non-lethal party favors.": "Waking one day you find a new report a Xenos fleet has arrived in system.

Your name is Charles.\n\nToday at lunch Christie handed you a note, pressed her finger to her lips and gave you a wink. \"After school. Room 413 in the abandoned hallway. Come alone. Tell no one,\" it read. You looked up at her confused but she shook her head and refused to talk about it.\n\nYou look down at the note and up at the dark hall. The floor is barricaded by six large trashcans but you easily push one out of the way and move past it, pushing it back into place behind you. This hallway hasn't been in use for at least a decade; but it was more than abandoned, it was also off-limits. It would be big trouble if you were caught trespassing in this area.\n\nYou give a careful look back over your shoulder and move down the hall, keeping an eye on the numbers painted above the doors. 407, 409, 411, 413. You stand briefly in front of the door. There are no lights on inside. Tentatively you reach for the handle and push open the door.\n\nThe room is being used to store old desks and chairs, there are several stacks of desks and chairs throughout the room. There are five people in the room, standing around or sitting on desks and chairs. They are four students and a teacher, the students are an enemy, a friend and a couple who are neither; all are surprised to see you. You smile nervously, arching your eyebrows up and giving an uncomfortable sort of wave.\n\nThere's something palpably creepy in the air, a sense that you are intruding on something very secretive. No one speaks for a long while, just staring at you as though willing you to turn around and leave.\n\n\"Close the door,\" the teacher, Dr. Verruckt says with a quiet urgency; breaking the silence. He is a thin older brunette man in his mid-forties with a receding hairline and a thinly shaved beard. \"Quickly now,\" he says. \"And quietly.\"\n", "Close the door.": "You give Dr. Verrukt a nod and make your way swiftly back to the door, closing it as quietly as you can manage. You turn back around to see everyone still staring at you, still unsure what to make of your presence.\n\n\"Hello,\" you say; taking your first real look around at the other occupants within. James is here, the linebacker for the Blossom Dale Knights; holding an aluminum baseball bat in his hands. You aren't exactly friends. There's Mike, a video game nerd you sometimes talk to; Frank, dressed perpetually in camouflage playing with a knife; and Destiny, beautiful breathtaking Destiny leaning against the wall and refusing to meet your eyes. It's like she'd rather be anywhere else but here.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\" Dr. Verrukt asked in a small intense tone.\n\n\"I...\" you begin, looking around; \"I don't actually know.\"\n\n\"You stumbled in here,\" Dr. Verrukt began hesitantly; \"into this specific room in the off-limits hall... By pure chance?\"\n\n\"No,\" you say. \"I mean... What is this? What are you doing in here?\"\n\nJames uncrosses his thick arms and takes a few steps forward. \"You don't get to ask questions, Chuck,\" he says. Then he points his finger into your chest. \"What the fuck are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Calm down, James;\" Dr. Verrukt says. \"I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason for his presence.\"\n\nJust then the door opens behind you and Christie steps in. \"Sorry I'm late,\" she says; ignoring the tension in the air. \"Oh good Charlie,\" she says to you; \"You made it.\"\n\n\"You invited him?!\" Dr. Verrukt asks, his arms flailing.\n\nChristie looks a little shaken. She takes a deep breath and nods. \"You said we needed more people,\" she explains slowly.\n\n\"I also said it was to remain a secret! The fact that you this young man knows about it at all makes it a poorly kept secret.\" Verrukt says, letting out wild growl of frustration. The room is quiet for a moment. The man takes a few deep breaths through his nose then speaks considerably more calmly. \"What you say is true,\" he admits. \"I did say we needed more people. I accept that I may not have been clear enough.\" He looks around at everyone in the room. \"When I said we need more people, I did NOT mean 'bring your friends'.\"Christie looks completely crestfallen, her face quite pale. James has his square jaw firmly clenched as he shakes his head and glowers at you. You look back to the doctor.\n\n\"This infraction will be excused because I did not technically forbid it. If ever you are unsure of something, check with me first. Is this understood?\" Verrukt looks pointedly at your friend and Christie nods. \"Very well then.\"\n\n\"Of all the idiots you could bring, Christie; you pick this fool?!\" James says, pointing his finger at you at you.\n\n\"Hey,\" you say.\n\n\"Enough,\" Dr. Verrukt says, stroking at the thin beard on his chin. \"We do need more people,\" he says. \"It is true that I have said as much. I was hoping to speak to them first, give them an interview of sorts; but I suppose what's done is done with this one. Christie, are you certain that this boy is trustworthy?\"\n\nChristie nods. \"I am sir, yes. I have known Charlie since we were both very young. He's a good guy and he can keep a secret.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your words,\" Dr. Verrukt says. \"James, you seem to be familiar with this young man as well. What is your opinion of him?\"\n\n\"I think he's a fucking asshole,\" James says.\n\nDr. Verrukt nods. \"I will confess that I do not personally know this young man. Can anyone else vouch for him?\"\n\nThere is silence from the rest of them for a few moments.\n\n\"I know him,\" Mike says. He clears his throat. \"He's alright. I trust him.\"\n\nDr. Verrukt nods. \"Anyone else?\" You don't expect Frank or Destiny to vouch for you; you've never really talked much to Frank and Destiny doesn't seem to even know you exist. She's so hot, you think; glancing over at her.\n\n\"Very well,\" Dr. Verrukt says; \"That will have to be good enough. Joseph, is it?\"\n\n\"It's Charles, actually;\" you say.\n\n\n\"There's not much we can do,\" Dr. Verrukt says. \"He's here now. We may as well include him.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" James says. \"This guy? Dr. Verrukt you can't be serious!\"\n\n\"What do you propose then, James?\"\n\n\"I propose we tell him to forget about this place and kick him the hell out of here,\" James says.\n\nDestiny leans forward off the wall. \"Why don't you let him decide?\" She says casually. James and Dr. Verrukt look at each other and then at you.\n\n\"Well?\" Dr. Verrukt says. \"You may leave if you wish, provided you tell no one about our meeting... Or you can join us and break new scientific ground.\"\n", "Leave": "Something didn't feel right about that room. There's no way you're going back in there. You figure you'll talk to Christie about it tomorrow. She'll understand. You've been friends for a long time.\n\nYou push a trash can out of the way and step out of the darkness. Mr. Lewis, one of the janitors, was sweeping the hall. \"School's closed, kid;\" he said. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I uh,\" you begin, your voice cracking. \"I forgot my homework.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"Good thing you came back before we locked up.\"\n\nYou give a little nervous laugh and head in the direction of your locker; walking right past it and out the door.\n\nYou live two blocks from school and the walk is uneventful. Your neighbors dog barks at you as you through the window as you step up onto your porch. You grab an apple from the kitchen and soon you are lost in your algebra work. You finish up your homework and do the dishes. You are such a dutiful son.\n\nYour mom comes home from work as you're settling into the couch and a Gilligan's Island rerun. She asks about your day and you give non-committal responses. She kisses you on your forehead like you're still a kid and walks into the kitchen.\n\nThere's a knock at the door that startles you from your work. Your mom answers it. \"Oh Christie,\" she says; \"Come on in honey.\" You glance over to see your friend leap through the air and tackle your mother to the ground.\n\nYou stand up in surprise as your mother screams in panic. Your friend is atop your mother, her mouth clamped around your mothers throat. Your mom looks over at you, tears glistening in her wide terror-filled eyes. \"Run,\" she says in a whimper as Christie tears her throat out and spits it to the ground.\n\nChristie looks up at you, your eyes meet for just a moment. Her face from cheek bones to jaw is covered in blood. She smiles a crimson smile, madness in her eyes; and drinks from the artery.\n", "Fight.": "\"Jesus Christ, Christie!\" You scream, throwing your remote at her and reaching for the poker beside the fireplace. You move in on her and she rises slowly to your feet with her crimson smile.\n\n\"So soon, Charlie?\" She asks. \"I'm not finished eating yet.\"\n\n\"What the fuck, Christie?!\" You scream; holding the poker up like a baseball bat. \"Look I'm sorry I didn't stay at the fucking cult meeting but... Fuck! You didn't have to kill me mom!\"\n\nShe laughs a twisted laugh. And starts walking over to you. \"You should have talked your friend into leaving with you,\" she tells you. \"She's still be alive if it weren't for you. Your mother would still be alive too.\"\n\nYou strike at her with the poker but she absorbs the blow with her forearm. You strike again and again she turns it around.\n\n\"If you'd talked Christie into leaving with you,\" she says; \"You wouldn't have to die.\"\n\nShe lunges forward with her mouth agape. Despite the blinding speed of her movement you are somehow able to step aside and smack her in the jaw with the iron poker; knocking her a few steps aside.\n\n\"Why do any of us have to die?\" You ask, your voice breaking.\n\n\"Because we hunger.\" She leaps at you and though you are able to crack her in the head with another blow of your fire poker; the weight atop you is more than you are able to bear. You fall on your back and she lunges again at your throat. You put the iron poker between you and keep her at bay as though bench pressing her.\n\n\"Struggle more,\" she says with a smile; blood dripping from her mouth onto your face. \"The blood is sweeter when it's hot.\"\n\nYou push her off of you and try to get to your feet but she is somehow up before you. She kicks you in the gut over and over again as you feel your insides bruising and tearing. Soon you can take no more and fall to your side. She kicks you over onto your back and smiles down at you.\n\n\"Good night, Charlie,\" she says in Christie's voice.\n\nThen she tears your throat out and drinks from your throat until everything goes dark.\n", "Flight": "\"Holy shit,\" You mutter. You slip quietly out the back door while Christie drains the life from your mother. She would have wanted you to survive. That's what you try to tell yourself anyway, all the while knowing your selfishness for what it is. You left her behind. She was dying anyway though, right? There was no chance of saving her. She died in terror while you slipped out the back door.\n\nYou don't even notice the tears running down your cheeks until the wind stings at it. The neighbors' dog barks at you from the other side of the fence. You are almost to the woods behind your house when you hear a noise behind you. You look back to see Christie staring at you from the porch. Her clothes were drenched with your mother's blood. The neighbor dog lets out a whine and backs away in fear.\n\n\"Where are you going, Charlie?\" She asks in a voice not her own.\n\n\"Fuck the path,\" you say, breaking into a run for the tree line. You are in the woods, moving through vines and bushes and wildflowers, all the while aware that Christie is behind you somewhere... gaining on you.\n\nA heavy weight slams into your back and you are forced to the ground. \"Thanks for running,\" she whispers into your ear. \"I like it you people run.\"\n\nYou try to crawl away from under her but she flips you over effortlessly and climbs atop you. She laughs and tears your throat out, spitting it aside. You are vaguely aware of the pain, focusing instead on other things. Like how cold it's getting, how dim the lights are going, how quiet the world is becoming. Soon you slip into a nothingness that consumes you.\n", "Join them.": "\"Welcome to the team then, Joseph. Allow me to explain what it is that we are doing here...\" He puts his hand over his chin, his long index finger reaching up to tap at the tip of his nose.\n\n\"Are you familiar with the Multiverse theory?\" You stare blankly back at him. \"What about multiple dimensions?\" You kind of squint a little and half shrug. He frowns. \"What if I told you there are an infinite number of alternate realities and universes?\" You raise your eyebrows a little, still unsure of what he's going on about.\n\nYour eyes wonder as he paces back and forth, excitedly explaining theories and concepts beyond your ability to understand. James is glowering at you; Destiny is filing her nails; and Mike and Christie are listening intently to the older man. You frown a little and focus your attention back on Dr. Verrukt.\n\n\"What I and my assistant discovered was that by using calcium carbonate to draw the correct runes; a door can be opened. It is a one-way door, but it is a door none the less. To return to our universe you must use the correct sequence of runes. My first assistant experimented without me and never returned. I assume he could not mark the correct runes to return home. This was years ago. He is assumed lost or dead.\"\n\n\"Stay with us so that you too can return home,\" he says with a smile. He walks over to an old slate board and draws an archway in white upon it. \"Before I open this portal though, there are a few things you must know.\" He looks you in the eyes very seriously, his left eye drifting ever so slightly off focus. \"If at all possible try not to make contact with anyone we meet. Be vague about who you are and if you should happen to run into yourself, absolutely do NOT make contact.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand,\" you say.\n\n\"You will,\" Mike says. \"Just stay close and observe.\"\n\nYou look over at Christie. She gives you a big grin and a thumbs up.\n\n\"Alright,\" you say.\n\n\"Good,\" Dr. Verrukt says. \"Now,\" he begins drawing a complex pattern of runs across the top arch of the portal. He talks as he draws the symbols in a very precise pattern. \"This series of symbols will take us to a mirror universe that is in some way somewhat different from our own. Observe,\" he tells you, drawing one final symbol. Suddenly the chalk drawn archway shimmers wind over water. It seems to change from a chalk board into mirror right before your eyes. On the other side is an exact reflection of the room you are all standing in with one notable exception... None of you are there. It's just the tables, desks, dust, and chairs.\n\n\"Whaaaaaaat...\" You say.\n\n\"This is a portal, Joseph;\" he says.\n\n\"Charles,\" you correct.\n\n\"On the other side is a world very much like our own but with one or more fundamental differences. There are countless other worlds out there, all you need is calcium carbonate and a large enough surface... And the dimensional address, of course. We've visited worlds where the Vikings conquered the Americas, where sciences were quite advanced or well behind...\"\n\nFrank nods. \"We visited this one place where everybody had little pet bears.\n\nDr. Verrukt nods in agreement. \"In the history of man in that world, they had tamed and domesticated the bear rather than the wolf. We've also been to worlds where saying the wrong word can get you killed. That's why it's important to do everything with a great deal of caution.\"\n\nWith that he wanders over to the board and studies the room on the other side of the portal. \"It looks safe enough,\" he says. \"Let's check it out, shall we?\" He asks. He does a quick head-count. There are seven of us then...\"\n\nHe chalks seven rough circles over the portal and smiles back at the rest of you. \"Step right up,\" he says with an awkward flourish. He steps over the wall and into the chalk board portal, stepping easily into the room on the other side.\n", "Step Inside": "Once Dr. Verrukt has stepped through the chalkboard portal you note that one of the circle's he'd drawn moments before disappeared. Frank steps through next and you watch as another circle disappears. James goes next followed by Destiny and then Christie; leaving you and Mike behind.\n\n\"Thanks for vouching for me,\" you tell him.\n\nHe sort of shrugs it off and waves it away. \"Hey whatever,\" he says. \"All I did was speak the truth. Now come on, let's check this world out.\" Without another word Mike steps through the portal leaving you alone behind them with a single circle remaining over the portal.\n\nYou take a deep breath and step through. As you step into the portal you find that you feel more like you are stepping out of a chalkboard than stepping into a new world. As soon as you step through Dr. Verrukt draws a portal on the blank chalkboard you stepped out of. Above it he carefully draws a series of runes slightly different than the ones he'd drawn to create the original portal.\n\n\"This is the way home,\" Dr. Verrukt said. \"If for any reason we are separated and you need to return home simply draw a circle above the archway and step through. The quality of your circle does not truly matter; you could draw a square or triangle just the same. All that matters is that your circle is closed.\"\n\n\"Why can't you just draw the circles now?\" you ask.\n\nDr. Verrukt looks at you very seriously. \"Because anyone can step through that portal if a circle is drawn.\" He turns to the others and tells them to partner up in groups of three.\n\n\nJames is with Destiny and Christie, he has his aluminum bat over his shoulder, Destiny holds a taser in her hand, and Christie carries a crowbar. Frank teams up with Dr. Verrukt and Mike, only Frank with his knives appears to be properly armed; Mike has a walking stick and the doctor carries some kind of device that looks like little more than a glorified cell phone.\n\n\"What about me?\" You ask.\n\n\"Join up with whoever you want,\" Dr. Verrukt tells you. \"Just follow their lead and do as they say.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" you say. \"But I don't have a weapon.\"\n\n\"Not very prepared are you genius?\" James mutters.\n\n\"Here,\" Frank says; handing you a fold-out pocket knife.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you mutter. You take a moment to look at the groups before making a decision.\n", "Join Destiny, Christie, and James": "You glance between your friend and your crush and decide that it's worth tolerating James to be in their presence.\n\n\"Great,\" James says. \"Me and three girls.\"\n\nDestiny ignores him, reaches for the door and says \"Come on.\"\n\nThe three of you begin walking down the hall toward the trash barricade and make your way around it. Everything is covered in dust, the halls are littered with papers and notebooks and other school related items. The place is so quiet that your footsteps sound like they should echo.\n\n\"Where did everyone go?\" Destiny asks in a hushed tone. \"It's so quiet.\"\n\nThe four of you continue to walk slowly down the hall. Christie opens the door to one of the classrooms only to find it empty of desk and chair; littered with papers and textbooks. Even the teachers desk is gone.\n\n\"This is eerie,\" Destiny comments.\n\n\"Listen, there are four of us,\" James points out; \"We can split up and cover more ground in groups of two.\"\n\n\"Good point,\" Christie says. Destiny nods along as well.\n\n\"Charlie,\" Destiny says. \"You're the new guy. Pick someone to team up with.\"\n\nYou look between them.\n\nJames, your nemesis; but also probably the one best able to protect you if something crazy happens.\n\nDestiny, your dream girl; any opportunity to spend some alone time with her would be worth it.\n\nChristie, your friend; the one in the group that you know the most about and would probably work the best with.\n\nSo. Who will it be?\n", "James": "\"What?\" James asks.\n\n\"I said I'm sticking with you,\" you tell him.\n\nDestiny shrugs. \"Cool,\" she says; \"Let's go check out the pool.\" She and Christie head for the double doors that lead to the swimming pool, leaving you alone with James in the empty hall. He doesn't look particularly pleased with you.\n\n\"Why in the hell would you pick me?\" He asks. \"I don't like you. You know that, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, looking at the floor. James shakes his head and the two of you move down the hall. He opens another classroom door to find it in a state of disarray, much like the classrooms you've seen already.\n\n\"I could be alone with either of those girls right now,\" he says aloud, frustration evident in his voice. He glares at you, closing the door behind him; then makes his way further up the hall until you reach another classroom. He opens the door to find it in the same condition as the others. \"I'm pretty sure Destiny is down for some action,\" he says, then as an after thought he says \"with me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I get it,\" you say.\n\n\"I don't think you do,\" James says, standing very close to you and jabbing his index finger into your chest. \"I'm talking about sex with Destiny. Fucking smoking hot Destiny. And me. Sexing it up.\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Hell, you could have picked her though; that would have been alright. I could have put the moves on Christie. I've caught her checking me out a few times, that would have been okay with me. She's cute,\" he tells you. \"But no, I'm stuck with you. For fucks sake!\"\n\nHe closes the door behind him and bypasses the next few classrooms, moving instead toward the exit at the end of the hall. The door there is barricaded shut from the outside where a bunch of chairs and desks are piled up against it.\n\n\"That explains the classrooms,\" James says.\n\n\"Yeah, but it answers it with more questions,\" you respond.\n\nJames nods at this, for once no agitated quip to shoot your way. He looks around trying to figure out what's going on. You are at the corner of two halls, the exit door at the turn. He turns slowly around, shaking his head all the while.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" James says. \"Are you gay, dude?\"\n\n\"What?\" You ask.\n\n\"You are, aren't you?\"\n\n\"No, I-\"\n\n\"Listen, it's okay;\" he tells you, resting a hand on your shoulder. \"I'm not judging you. It explains why you chose to hang with me instead of one of the babes though.\"\n\n\"I'm not gay,\" you tell him.\n\n\"Whatever,\" he says. \"Just walk in front of me from now on, alright?\"\n\nYou let out a growl of frustration and make the turn to the other hall, leading the way past empty classroom after empty classroom. Occasionally you stop to check out a room; finding the same sort of mess each time. Each room is bereft of chairs and desks and littered with trash.\n\n\"Every room is the same,\" you mutter.\n\n\"Yeah,\" James says. \"This would be way less boring if I were making out with one of the girls. God, you're such a douche.\"\n\n\"A douche is a sanitary product,\" you reply; \"So I will take that as a compliment.\" There is a moment of extreme-silence after you say this before James bursts out laughing. It is a deep rumbling belly laugh and he reaches for the wall to maintain his balance.\n\nThe moment is interrupted by a shout that echoes through the halls toward you. \"-to the portal!\" you hear.\n\n\"Shit,\" James says, his face serious. \"Come on, we need to get back.\" He jogs out of the room, back up the hall to the barricaded door, and breaks into a full run toward the trash-can line. You do your best to catch up but his long legs quickly put some distance between the two of you.\n\nAs he reaches the line of trash cans you see Frank, Mike, and Dr. Verrukt rounding the bend ahead at an all-out run. Behind them, a strange dough-colored figure chases them. Beside you the door to the pool opens and Christie steps out, nearly barreling into you. Her eyes are wide with fear, her face covered in a sheen of sweat.\n\n\"Where's Destiny?\" You ask.\n\n\"Run,\" she says in a chilling whisper. A moment later she is past you.\n\nThe doors to the pool open once more and you see Destiny step out. She is covered in blood from her mouth to her chest. She smiles at you, the dark stain of blood on her teeth. \"Hello, Charlie;\" she says in a voice not quite her own.\n\nThe hairs on the back of your neck stand and a chill runs through you. You look down the hall where Christie is reaching the abandoned hall, the others right behind her. You look back at Destiny, who is stepping closer. A sort of whimper escapes your mouth and you break into a run.\n\nYou can tell you're not moving fast enough by the looks on Frank and Mike's faces. A weight slams into your back and drives you face down to the floor, your cheek squeaking against the linoleum. You look up to see Mike and Dr. Verrukt escaping down the hall. Frank, on the other hand; runs toward you.\n\n\"Get off him, you bitch!\" Frank says when he is upon you, kicking at the woman on your back. You feel the weight roll off of you and you slide to your feet.\n\nDestiny smiles up at him. \"You're feisty,\" she says; \"I will enjoy devouring you.\"\n\nFrank steps forward, dropping to his knees; and stabs her in the eye with his knife, burying the blade to the heel. It has no affect. She smiles at him and grabs him about the shoulder, pulling him toward her.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" he swears. Suddenly she lunges her head forward, her teeth clamping around his throat. His eyes go wide for a moment and meet yours, then they go dead as she bites in; tearing his throat out and spitting it aside. She buries her face in the gore of it and you take this opportunity to try and stand up and scurry away.\n\nA hand reaches out and grabs at your ankle; the grip is like iron. She pulls you down and drags you toward her. Sweet beautiful Destiny all covered in gore with a look of pure malice in her eyes. \"Don't run away, Charlie;\" she says with a horrifying giggle. \"My friend will want to see you.\"\n\nShe hold you in place while you stare at the empty hall and watch as the strange dough-like figure in the distance draws near. It is a featureless pale creature like a play-dough man. It moves agonizingly slowly. You are praying for death by the time it reaches you. Your death does not come quick.\n\nThe creature reaches out with one its fingerless appendages and strokes briefly at the side of your face. Then, as the doughy appendage reaches your temple, you feel it latch on. You feel your surface thoughts leave you, then some buried memories rise up and exit. You can feel thoughts and memories being sucked into the appendage, leaving your mind forever like something forgotten. One by one your knowledge escapes you, sucking into the creature and as you stare at it you note that the features begin to manifest. Soon it is like looking into a mirror, and then you are not sure who exactly is staring back at you.\n\nYour senses dim as a certain coldness settles over you.\n\nAnd then there is nothing.\n", "Destiny": "\"I'll go with Destiny,\" you say, smiling shyly and walking over.\n\n\"Whatever,\" Destiny says, rolling her eyes. \"Come on, let's check the pool out.\"\n\nYou follow her lead to the pool's double doors, leaving Christie with James in the hall. Inside the air is thick with the smell of stagnant water, the pool murky. The tiled floor is slippery and gross.\n\n\"Go for a swim?\" You suggest facetiously.\n\nDestiny shakes her head, taking you serious. \"Not in that water,\" she says. \"No way.\"\n\n\"I wasn't serious,\" you tell her, feeling your face flush as you scratch at the back of your head self consciously.\n\n\"Come on,\" she says; \"Let's check out the locker rooms.\" She pushes the ladies locker room open and you follow her inside. Your mind goes back to all the times you've thought of encountering her in the locker room, but none of your fantasies went quite like this. Still though, you think as you admire the sway of her hips; there are worse things you could be doing with your time.\n\n\"Stop looking at my ass,\" she says without turning around.\n\n\"I wasn't-\" you start to protest.\n\n\"Yes you were,\" she says. She stops and turns around to face you. \"Look Charlie, I know you've had a crush on me since like forever.\"\n\n\"Well,\" you begin, but she presses a finger against your lips.\n\n\"Hush,\" she says. \"You're sweet Charlie, but you and me? We run in different circles. There's no way we would work.\"\n\nDespite the fact that she is stating the obvious, revealing truths you've understood for years... you still feel your heart drop a little.\n\n\"Okay,\" you say, looking at your feet.\n\nThen she leans forward and does the last thing you expect. Her lips are soft and taste of vanilla. She parts her lips and slips a tongue into your mouth. Your heart races in your chest and you feel your body heat rise as you kiss her back. She grabs the back of your head and kisses you deeper. You grab her butt, momentarily startling her. In that moment it feels like there is nothing else happening in all the world. She bites a little at your lower lip and pulls away. You almost stumble forward but catch yourself.\n\n\"That was nice,\" she says; wiping at the spit on her lips with the back of her hand. \"It's too bad we don't match up. You're a good kisser.\"\n\nYou stutter and stumble, unable to find the right words for the situation. She smiles a bit at this and shakes her head as you struggle to form your thoughts into sentences. Her smile turns to curiosity and confusion, then to fear as she looks over your shoulder. You feel the hairs raise on the back of your neck and turn slowly around.\n\nLurching toward you is a featureless pasty white human-ish creature. Its skin is like raw biscuit shaped into a man; complete with kneading divots. Its face is featureless, no mouth, no eyes, no nose; a blank canvas.\n\nYou stumble backwards and trip over your feet, falling onto your ass just beside Destiny. She doesn't move. She seems fixated on the approaching creature. You have a heavy feeling in your stomach and an unexplainable sense of terror as the thing reaches out a fingerless doughy limb toward Destiny. The appendage strokes at her face almost gently but when it reaches her temples it stops.\n\nDestiny goes suddenly stiff, her eyes wide. The longer the creature holds her the weaker she appears. As you watch, backing slowly away; you see the dough like creature begin to take on her features. Eventually Destiny slides backward to the ground, the creature standing over top her. The creature has become her. They are mirror images, one standing over the other.\n\nDestiny-on-the-ground is motionless.\n\nDestiny-standing-over lunges her face suddenly forward and tears out her throat; drinking the blood like a lost desert traveler coming suddenly upon an oasis. When she is done, she turns her face in your direction. Her eyes meet yours, gore dripping from her face. She smiles a crimson smile.\n\nThoroughly frightened, you scramble backwards like a crab; moving toward the pool.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" She asks in a voice that both is and is not Destiny's. \"Come back over here, Charlie.\" You continue backing away and she begins walking toward you seductively. \"Maybe we can kiss some more?\" she asks; innocence dripping with malice.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" you manage to croak out. You feel the door behind you and stand to turn the knob, but before you can grip it; Destiny is upon you. You feel her teeth sink into the back of your neck, the flesh tearing away. You fall into the wall and she spins you around, smiling wildly.\n\n\"You are delicious,\" she says. Then she tears your throat out and drinks.\n", "Christie": "\"I'll go with Christie,\" you say.\n\nJames and Destiny pass a look between them and Destiny rolls her eyes. \"Alright,\" she says; \"James where would you like to go?\"\n\n\"Let's check out the pool,\" he says. The two of them head a little farther up the hall until they reach the double doors that lead to the swimming pool. You watch them as they step inside. He smacks her ass as they go. Classy.\n\n\"You didn't want alone time with your dream girl?\" Christie asks with an arched brow.\n\n\"Nah,\" you tell her coolly; \"I'd rather work with you. I at least know you.\"\n\n\"At least,\" she agrees. \"Come on, let's go check some more rooms out.\"\n\nThe two of you walk along, checking on classrooms as you go but finding each one the same as before; floor littered with notebooks, loose papers, pencils, and textbooks; the rooms completely devoid of desk or chair. You and Christie aren't sure what to make of it.\n\nSoon you come to the end of a long hall where one of the school exits is located. You find the outside of the door is barricaded shut by a mess of chairs and desks.\n\n\"That answers one question,\" Christie comments absently.\n\n\"Yeah, but why?\" You ask. She has no answer for you. Not that you expected one.\n\nYou check more doors down the hall but after a few more classrooms she stops in the hall with a big smile on her face. She spreads her arms out to her sides and spins around. \"What do you think?\" she asks.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About the portal,\" she says seriously. \"Being able to experience alternate universes. Limitless possibilities.\"\n\n\"It's pretty cool in theory,\" you say after some thought. \"But I hope the other worlds are more exciting than this place. This one is... boring. And kind of creepy.\"\n\nChristie nods. \"It is. The other worlds I've been to were much more exciting.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" you ask. \"What was the most exciting?\"\n\nChristie is about to answer when a loud scream echoes through the halls. \"Back to the portal!\" the voice calls. Christie and you share a look and make your way hastily back up the hall from where you came.\n\nYou meet Mike, Frank, and the doctor at the trash cans.\n\n\"What is it?\" Christie asks. Before any of them can answer you see a pale pasty featureless creature running toward you; its face is blank. It has the appearance of uncooked dough.\n\n\"Hurry,\" Dr. Verrukt says, opening the door to room 413 while the rest of you are still navigating past the line of trash cans. You bring up the rear despite the terror you feel and are the last one in the room.\n\n\"Where's James and Destiny?\" Frank asks.\n\n\"They went into the pool,\" you tell him.\n\n\"Shit,\" he says.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply.\n\n\"Come on,\" Christie tells you both frantically. \"We need to leave.\"\n\nFrank shakes his head. \"I don't feel right leaving them behind. He starts stepping around the trash cans again, into the hall where the dough-like creature approaches. You lock eyes with Frank for a moment.\n\n\"Stay or go, man. It's up to you.\"\n", "Stay": "\"I'm coming with you,\" you tell him.\n\n\"Well come on then we need to be quick,\" he says.\n\nThe strange dough creature is roughly fifteen paces away when you step out from the abandoned hall and follow him, running as fast as your legs will carry you to the pool. You chance a glance over your shoulder and find the dough-like beast has fallen back to nearly twenty paces behind you.\n\nYou follow Frank into the pool where the smell of stagnant water assaults your senses. \"James!\" Frank is calling. \"Destiny!\" There is no answer. You find their discarded clothes on the floor outside of the girls locker room and call Frank over. On the far side of the pool where the doors stand, you are filled with dread as the strange dough-like featureless creature steps into the room.\n\n\"Well I guess we know where those two went off to,\" Frank says, sarcastic despite the tension in the air. \"A fine time for this bullshit.\" He pushes the door to the locker room open and you follow him just a few steps behind.\n\n\"Shit,\" Frank says the moment he steps into the first row of lockers. You stand beside him, your eyes falling onto a horrific scene. Destiny and James are both there, nakedly sprawled across the tiled floor; their stomachs cut open and their innards spilled out.\n\n\"What happened to them?\" You ask, your voice sounding weak and shrill in your ears.\n\n\"We need to get out of here,\" Frank says; backing toward the door that leads back to the pool. \"Now.\"\n\nYou follow him, stepping back into the stench of stagnant water. The dough creature is only a few feet away. Frank takes you the long way around the pool. It's fortunate, you think; that this strange creature moves so slowly.\n\n\"Hey guys,\" comes a familiar voice from just ahead of you. James steps out from the other locker room.\n\n\"James?\" Frank asks. He stops walking, you do the same.\n\n\"What are you guys doing here?\" he asks.\n\n\"You can't be...\" Frank began, but swallowed the rest of his sentence nervously.\n\nSomething touches your shoulder and you jump forward, spinning around to find the dough creature standing just a foot away; its long handless limbs reaching out for you. Somehow, in its eyeless gaze, you become lost in wonder. The creature is both horrifying and beautiful. There is a perfection in its absence of form. Its limbs are almost like tentacles, and soon there is one on either side of your face.\n\nBehind you, you are dimly aware of Frank shouting something at James. You glance back for a moment to see Frank swinging the blade of a pocketknife at the linebacker. The blade cuts deep across James' throat but the big guy doesn't move or react in anyway.\n\nThe doughy tentacles pull you back. You are wide-eyed and perspiring with fear and you start to feel the limbs pulling at something as they latch onto your temples. You feel a few repressed memories rise to the surface of your mind and flow into the tentacles, leaving you. More memories surface and exit through your temples, sucked into the creature. Soon you remember very little about where you are or who you are and not long after you are left with not even that.\n\nYou feel a sensation of pain as your stomach is torn open. As you drop to the ground you see the creature feeding on you and when it rises it has become you.\n\nYou go numb and cold as the world seems to fade away around you.\n", "Go": "\"Good luck,\" you tell him. He doesn't take the time to respond. You make haste following the rest of your group into the room and stepping through the portal. Christie is the last one through, she drops the chalk on the tray as she goes and you check the space above the portal to see no circles remaining. As you hastily draw a circle for yourself you hear the door open behind you. You glance over your shoulder as the dough-like creature points its eyeless face in your direction. It doesn't move, simply studies you.\n\nYou drop the chalk and step slowly through the portal, leaving the dough creature behind and stepping out of the chalkboard on the other side into the safety of your own world.\n\nDr. Verrukt almost shows a glimpse of emotion for a moment. Then he speaks in his dry voice. \"That is one universe we will not be returning to,\" he says. He takes an eraser and removes the final two runic characters from above the portal.\n\n\"Dr. Verrukt,\" Mike says hesitantly; \"You knew what that thing was didn't you?\"\n\nThe older man seems reluctant to answer but at lasts he nods. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Whatever that thing is, it's the reason my assistant did not come back. He must have panicked trying to open a portal home. We were running from one of those creatures.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" Mike asks.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Verrukt answers. \"I don't wish to discuss it now. Allow me to collect my thoughts and we can discuss it tomorrow, yes?\" He looked around at the other students and all agreed. \"Good,\" he says. \"For now, we will wait for the return of James, Destiny, and Frank.\"\n\n\"What if they don't come back?\" You ask.\n\n\"Let's hope it doesn't come to that,\" Dr. Verrukt says.\n\nAs the minutes tick by it becomes increasingly apparent that the others are not coming back. At least not anytime soon. Dr. Verrukt is the first to leave. He says that he will talk to the rest of you tomorrow and walks out the door. As more time passes Mike leaves as well, saying his parents will be expecting him home soon.\n\nThis leaves only you and Christie to huddle in the dark of room 413. The two of you alternate between sitting, standing, and pacing around. You chance glances over at the portal but mostly try to avoid looking at it. Nothing happens. No one steps through.\n\nYou hear something brush up against the outside of the door and see the custodian Mr. Lewis sweeping the hall.\n\n\"We should go,\" Christie says sadly when Mr. Lewis was past the door. \"I don't think they're coming back.\"\n"}, "tree": {"": {"Close the door.": {"Leave": {"Fight": "END", "Flight": "END"}, "Join them.": {"Step Inside": {"Join Destiny, Christie, and James": {"James": "END", "Destiny": "END", "Christie": {"Stay": "END", "Go": {"Go home.": "END"}}}, "Destiny": "END"}}}, "Join them.": "END"}}}, {"title": "The Northern Settlement", "stories": {"First sight of shore": "You can't see the shore, or the bay that you should arrive at today. Every passenger is given a few hours to stand on deck, so they can get some fresh air and sunlight. You're taking yours now hoping you can get a glance of the land that you'll soon call home for the next few years.\n\n\nYou made your mark on a piece of paper that says you'll be living at this new settlement for the next three years. You can't read, so you made sure to memorize as much of the contract as possible. You're required to work for your new lord for thirty to sixty days every year. You have rights as a citizen of the community and a vote at the village moot of what ever towns, settlements, or villages are formed that you live in. You may practice what ever trade you are a member of, and are not required to be a member of a union to do so.\n\n\nYour new lord is George Godbole. He doesn't have a title. He's a fourth son of some petty noble family, and since his father is still alive, George hasn't inherited his title yet. He won't either so long as his three eldest brothers are still alive.\n\n\nMost of the people coming with you on the voyage are Georgians. The Kingdom was named after Captain George the second. You think that George Godbole was named after him, but you can't be certain. George is a common name among Georgians. \n\n\nYou aren't a Georgian though. You're Front, or a Frontsman. Georgians are part of George's Kingdom, or the Georgian Kingdom. Front are the people that didn't want to live under the Captain's rule. So  you moved beyond what the Crew could rule. The Crew being nobility among Georgians. You were told you could receive additional payment as a scout and prospector for being a Frontsman. Since Georgians think all Frontsman are from the very Fringe of civilization, and have done that sort of work before. Of course you match that stereotype, so you don't mind getting paid for it.\n\n\nOne of the sailors calls out that he can see land. You stay in a spot where you know you'll stay out of the sailors way, and you think you'll be able to see the land from your vantage point.\n\n\n\"Arthur!\" You hear your name called. The other migrants are making their way to the deck to get a view of the land ahead.\n\n\nAs you turn you see your friend David Singh, making his way to you from the crowd. His older Sister Marissa following him.\n\n\n\"Can you see it yet?\" David asks\n\n\n\"Of course not. it's only just been spotted from the top of the mast.\" Marissa answers for you.\n\n\nYou watch for a few minutes and see a mountain covered in snow slowly climb out of the horizon.\n\n\n\"I'm going to go down and get my gear ready for landfall.\" You say to your companions.\n\n\nA passing crewman interjects before you can move below deck. \"Mount Jut is the first thing we'll see, but it goes up beyond where the air goes. We might still be a few days out from the harbor proper. Wait a little bit before you get your things. At least until we can see the harbor.\"\n\n\nYou watch for some time longer as the mountain comes into better view. Watching for over an hour you don't even see the range the mountain is a part of before your time on deck is over. You return below deck with the excited chatter of David following you.\n\n\n\"...that mountain is going to be visible from just about any point on the continent. We'll never be able to get lost with something like that on the horizon.\"\n\n\n\"One point of reference won't be enough to stop everyone from getting lost. It will help though.\" Marissa corrects.\n\n\n\"Don't be a spoil sport Marissa. We'll always be able to tell which direction is North with that mountain.\"\n\n\nAs long as you've known the siblings, David has always been excitable by most prospects, and Marissa has always tried to temper him and keep his exuberance factually correct. You'd probably be bothered by it if she corrected you like that too. David once explained it to you that she was told by their father that because they're sub-crew that they were expected to be educated and correct in as much as is possible. She was given the job of correcting her younger brother.\n\n\nYou make your way over to the common area and find a place to sit with your friends. They've always had so much to say that you never needed to say anything yourself, so you add very little to the conversation. You listen to the siblings argue and talk for a few hours. Then you go to bed. You were fortunate enough to get a top bunk. David picked a bottom bunk and once on the trip while hanging his head over the side of his bunk with seasickness, the man in the bunk above him became sick as well. He wasn't given anymore water than his normal ration to get clean. It took a few days for the smell to leave him.\n", "(Bit of History about the people of the world.)": "(An excerpt from the Journal of Marissa Singh)\n\n\nI figure I might as well write down most things I know, because in the six generations since the colony ship made planetfall, people have forgotten a lot of things. We only remember a few countries, but some Frontsmen remember that they're American Italian, or American Polish. America, Canada and India are the countries everyone is sure of.\n\n\nAll of the humans and a good number of the plants and animals here are from a planet called Earth. I don't know much about Earth besides the animals you can eat come from there. No animal that comes from this planet, called Hera, can be eaten by a human without a lot of vomiting, and potentially death. The upside of that is that none of the predators here can eat a human, or most of the terran animals without the same thing happening. That doesn't really help you if you're eaten, but the creature that eats a man or woman won't survive the experience either.\n\n\nBack on Earth there were two countries that were right next to each other. The people from those countries were so alike you could mistake a citizen of one for the other. One was called America, the other was called Canada. A wealthy ecentric in America had a ship made in space to go to other planets that circled other stars. He registered the ship in Canada though and hired a Canadian crew. A large portion of the crew were imigrants or second generation imigrants from a country called India. This has left a large portion of the crew with darker skin than the rest of the colonists. Though there are dark skinned colonists as well.\n\n\nThe colonists that boarded the ship were mostly American. The ecentric, who's name was Jason Goble, did not come on the trip, but rather planned to come along on another ship, if his experiments in anti-aging medecines came to fruition.\n\n\nThe crew and colonists were put into a cryogenic storage system for the journey that with faster than light travel took hundreds of years. The Crew woke up periodically to maintain the ship and it's systems. The plan had been to find the planet that was capable of bearing life and then return. That plan failed. The ship lost several systems along the way that were necessary for a return trip. The Captain upon arriving to the predestined system found that it had a life bearing world. He landed the ship on the planet, even though the ship was not meant to land on a planet ever.\n\n\nThen various issues arrived. The crew maintained the discipline of a near military vessel and continued with a dictatorship. Many of the American colonists didn't accept the rule of the crew. Those people left for the far fronteers and beyond what the crew could govern with the supplies and tools they could carry. The next colony ship should have arrived within forty years at the most. It's been two hundred years since planetfall. The people that stayed behind and lived under the rule of the crew were counting on that. Because of this there are now five distinct peoples.\n\n\nCrew: The staff officers of the ship maintained the ship to the best of thier abilities and have done their best to keep the people they rule in good health and comfort. Outside of a few systems on the ship, which has been renamed the Palace, we have lost the use and understanding of electricity. The Decendents of the staff officers are now considered Nobility and have spread to the various provinces that the kingdom hold rule over.\n\n\nSub-Crew: The crew that were not staff officers frequently hold offices below that which the nobles have rule over. I myself am of Sub-crew descent. Most of us are literate and have a better education than most.\n\n\nGeorgians: The colonists who stayed with the crew now call themselves Georgians. This is after the second captain named the crew ruled kingdom, George's kingdom. \n\n\nFront or Frontsman: The people that went out into and beyond the Fronteer of the Georgian kingdom. They have formed various republics and petty kingdoms, many still maintaining light ties of family and trade to the Georgian kingdom.\n\n\nVic: These people are the American colonists that decided that they would rebel against crew rule. Originally founded by a man named Victor Gomez, the Vic decided to take by force what they needed to survive on the world. They are frequently indistinguishable to many Georgians from the Front. Which has led to various skirmishes and border wars with Front settlements that were uneccessary.\n", "First Landing": "You wake and take your time before getting ready to see the deck. You take your time dressing and eating breakfast. David interrupts this.\n\n\n\"Arthur! They can see the bay!\"\n\n\nYou immediately tip the last of your breakfast into your mouth and run to where you keep your equipment. You have a small knife and a heavier one, a Frontsman musket, that can shoot accurately up to nearly three hundred meters because of it's rifled barrel, a small spade, hatchet, folding saw, mess tin, and heavier clothes. You quickly gather up all of your gear with the ammunition and a worry stone that you carry.\n\n\nDavid is still struggling with his effects. As a silver smith, his tools will likely take longer to make it to shore than yours will. You helped him load both his and his sisters belongings on the ship, but seeing as there's no dock here you think he's getting ahead of himself. You don't imagine the smiths will be offloaded before the miners will be.\n\n\nYou walk up the stair case that the sailors keep calling a ladder and find yourself on the deck of the ship once more. The cold wind bites the bare skin you have exposed on your face. You find a place to look over the land that stretches out before you. Everything is currently covered in snow. Mount Jut stands above you beyond the nearest mountain range. The best way you can think to describe the mountain, is that it's like a prize bull standing among chickens when compared to the other mountains. Nothing poetic about it, it's just that big. The nearest mountains are still a few miles away. There are still wide plains and plenty of forest to build shelter and find fuel.\n\n\nIt's still early spring but you hope summer comes soon all the same. You help some of the sailors load up one of the longboats, keeping your gear on your person as you do it. You do a good bit of the loading from inside of the boat and before you know it, all of the gear is loaded up, yourself included.\n\n\nYou realize that it's a first come first serve going to shore. Maybe you should have helped the Singhs with their things, but it's a bit late for that. Then again, there's only one sub-crew on the boat, everyone else looks like Frontmen.\n\n\nEveryone is quiet as the boat is rowed to shore. The pair of sailors at the front of the boat jump out early and cuss when their feet hit the water and pull the boat closer to land. Everyone helps unload the boat as quickly as possible. Once unloaded the sailors push back off to the ship.\n\n\nYou look around the bay where you've stopped and see that the forest comes up to the edge of most of it with the exception of the rocky protrusion that cuts off the bay from the rest of the sea.\n\n\nAn older Front speaks up. \"Longteeth over here, striplings over there.\"\n\n\nYou walk over with the other youths to where he indicated the striplings should stand. He points at you and another youth then motions you to follow him. After that he gestures the other old timers to go in other directions. A few are left behind to watch the supplies. You follow the old timers and listen to the forest around you. Most of the birds are the same that you're familiar with down south. Only two maybe three birds you'll need to figure out. \n\n\nYou walk in the direction for awhile. You see sign of local rodents, and a set of tracks for a opax, which is the local version of a deer. Neither are anything you can eat, but it's something with a skin that will keep you warm and fat that still burns. Your group stops when you see the side of a tree that's had the bark torn up twice the size of a man. \"Bear.\" Is all you say. You wouldn't be surprised if bear made it this far north. Most terrain Predators can't eat Heran animals. The bear decided that rule didn't apply to it. It could be a a bear or the local equivalent of that. Apex predators are worth reporting though. Your group turns around an goes back to where the supplies were dropped.\n\n\nYou get back to the supplies and see where one of the other scout groups have come back. You wait for the others before the longteeth give the reports to the group.\n\n\n\"Deer sign, Opax sign.\" One said. \n\n\n\"Opax sign, Rain deer sighted.\" another said.\n\n\n\"Opax sign, Bear sign. Four meter high reach.\" Your longtooth says.\n\n\n\"Indig sign.\" The last scout says.\n\n\nNo one says anything about the last report. Indigs are the name for the native Sapient population. The first Captain brought the colony ship down in the most fertile least populated part of the world. That didn't mean there weren't indigs there. It's a mixed history humans have with indigs. Some of the tribes were uplifted and are now a part of the Georgian nation, others joined the Vics and raided other indig and human settlements. Some were destroyed a few were turned into slaves after a lost war. It all depends on who the indigs ran into first and how they respond to outsiders.\n\n\nYou wait with the others watching the treeline and the ship. More Longboats come ashore and you take turns, taking watch and helping unload the boats. After awhile, some people start setting up large low tents and fires.\n", "Establishing the settlement": "You wait for a while with the gear. The longboat makes several trips back and forth as you take guard. Eventually one of George Godboles handpicked officers has you move the supplies to an area that's having some earthworks dug out. Nothing really impressive, just throwing enough dirt up to make it a bit harder if the local Indigs decide to charge the camp.\n\n\n\"You'll all be serving your month of service starting now for this year.\" the officer informs you before giving out instructions. A few of you are sent to set up a watch, while most of your group, including yourself, is sent to go cut lumber to quickly throw up log cabins for a more permanent shelter.\n\n\nYou find space in one of the tents to stow your gear and help both cut down, saw, and haul trees into position to be made into more weatherproof shelters. For the next several days you get up before dawn, eat the rations that are made available, and work until you're given a break for lunch and then dinner. After dinner you go to bed, and the next day you do the same thing all over again.\n\n\nYou don't even see the Singhs for the first several days. You see David on about the third day.\n\n\n\"Arthur! Hey Arthur!\"\n\n\nYou turn and wave to David as he leaves the cabin he's building.\n\n\n\"Arthur! Have you been assigned a cabin yet?\"\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\"Oh good! Marissa and I have one that's planned out already. We're assigned four people to a cabin with exception to married couples. I can get a cabin with Marissa because we're family, but I have less control of who stays with us. I was hoping you'd be willing to room with us.\"\n\n\nDavid wasn't bad company on the trip here. Living in the next bunk wouldn't be really all that different than how things were on the ship.\n\n\n\"Sure David. I'll live with you. Most of my work is going to be out and about, so it'll give me a place to keep my things and you'll mostly have the space to yourself.\"\n\n\n\"That's great Arthur! I'll put your name on the list!\"\n\n\nDavid then ran off to go back to what he was doing before. You went back to move the next log. Two weeks later you are rooming with the Singhs and a friendly miner by the name of Ander Olson. In three weeks the  town was built. The Cabins weren't pretty by any means, but they kept a good bit of the heat in and the majority of the wet out. The officer in charge of your work crew let everyone know that they still owed a week of work, but that would need to wait for later in the year.\n\n\nFinally a free man you find yourself in a position to begin scouting. No one really knows much about the land here besides there's plenty of metal in the mountains, and a lot of fur bearing animals just about everywhere. You'll be given some fresh fish eggs to drop into the ponds lakes and streams so that next year there will be plenty of trout and salmon to eat, You can do just about anything you would care to and after living in the Georgian kingdom the freedom gives you a high no ale ever has.\n\n\n\"Arthur?\" Your thoughts are interrupted and you finish packing to leave. \"David and I know how to smith silver, but nothing's been brought down from the mountains. Would you mind if David and I went with you? At least until a mine opens up.\" It's Marissa.\n\n\nYou take a moment to think over your answer. It's a common enough Frontsman practice to think before you speak. It drives most Georgians crazy though.\n\n\nGoing with two people with you would be safer. If you get hurt you would absolutely be able to get help. On the other hand neither of them are at all familiar with so much as how to set up a shelter. You would need to teach them just about everything but how to make a fire. That will slow you down and may very well lose you time, money and very possibly food in your belly at times.\n", "Bring the Singhs with you.": "\"Alright. Get any warm clothes, tools, and food that will travel well.\"\n\n\n\"Oh thank you Arthur! I'll get David! We'll be along shortly!\"\n\n\nYou get the sudden feeling that things are going to be moving much slower for you after this. Hopefully they have warm shoes at least. When the pair of them are finished packing you need to spend a while adjusting the straps of the packs they've chosen. You also have them put a few things back in the cabin. A cotton blanket will likely kill them as keep them warm. Cotton absorbs water to easily for it to be a good choice. With that you make your way out of the settlement.\n\n\nYou walk past the fence that's been built up around the town that's just been started. Passing by open ground that's covered in the stumps of trees that now make up the town, you find yourself in a position to make another decision about your future.\n\n\nYou can head up to the mountains and start prospecting for the metals up there. The scan printouts that George Godbole saw before bringing you here only stated that the mountains had metal in them. Never did he mention anything about what kind of metals. One of the fastest ways you can help the Singhs is to find a vein of silver ore for them.\n\n\nOn the other hand you don't know a ton about prospecting. Sure you can recognize gold, silver, copper, tin and the like. You just couldn't say much more than that. Maybe that's all you need though.\n\n\nYou do know how to hunt though. You know how animals think for the most part, and you know what they need. You've killed and skinned plenty of animals, and you have the gear you need to process the carcass. If you can bring down an earth beast you have food, a hide, and maybe even the oil you can get from the fat. A Heran animal will get you a hide, and the oil. God knows you can make a decent living off of lamp oil and all the furs you're going to be able to ship back. It's the trade you had in mind when you came on this voyage, and it's the trade you came equiped for.\n", "Take the Singhs prospecting.": "Might as well try your hand at prospecting. The animals will still be there when you're done looking for valuable metals. If you can find a silver vein it'll get the Singhs work they know too. Best get started now though, because once someone lays claim to the land the metal is under, you won't have access to it.\n\n\nYou start walking to the mountains. The pair of siblings bring their own food, clothes and a constant stream of chatter. David is to much of a social creature to not speak to whoever is near him, and Marrissa is mostly picking your brain about anything you know about prospecting. Which admittedly isn't much.\n\n\nYou spend the next several days walking. You walk through the open areas and the forested areas and little bit by little bit the incline increases. You eventually hit foothills and start meandering through those. You see sign for some of the same creatures that were reported before. You occasionally see smoke from the fires of other prospectors or maybe some of the natives.\n\n\nWhile looking through the hills you find a few roots you can add to your rations. Not much else seeing how early in spring it is. Traveling slowly up the mountain you look back and see the settlement on the horizon. It's a brown patch surrounding a stony outcrop, that itself is surrounded by the large fields and forests still covered in snow. Beyond that is the slowly rolling waves of the sea. You take it all in for a moment before continuing to where you think streams have dug into the mountain side.\n\n\nYou've chosen one of the deep draws up the side of the mountain range that no one else has bothered with. You know copper is green and gold glitters much like it does when it's smelted. After that you don't really know what you're looking for. You come across some brownish rocks that are crystaline in form.\n\n\n\"That's Hemetite! Good find Arthur. We're going to make a fortune off of this. DAVID! OVER HERE!\" Marrissa inturupts your thoughts as you handle the crystal.\n\n\n\"It's what?\" You say.\n\n\n\"Hemetite. It's a crystaline form of iron.\"\n\n\n\"What did you find?!\" David says as he jogs up.\n\n\n\"Hemetite.\" Marrissa replies.\n\n\n\"What's that?\" David says and you are absolutly certain you are going to hate that word in the next hour.\n\n\nAfter the sibling finish repeating the conversation you just had, the three of you collect as many of the crystals as you can carry in your packs and pockets. Marrissa ties a shawl to a stick she plants in the ground at the bottom of the draw.\n\n\n\"What's that for?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"It's a land claim. We now own that mine up there.\" Marrissa replies.\n\n\n\"Not much of a mine is it?\n\n\nDavid pipes up. \"It's the Singh Donaldson Iron mine, and we're going to make a fortune off of it.\"\n\n\n\"Wait. We're not going to sell it? I thought you two needed silver!\" You say.\n\n\n\"We need silver to be silver smiths. We need an iron mine to be mine owners. One of those things makes a lot more money than the other.\"\n\n\nYou don't have a reply to that, but there goes your plans for a simple life as a seasonal hunter.\n\n\nYou bag a few of the opax and take the fat and hides off of them as you go back to the settlement. You're out of rations the last day of walking back. You get scrip for the hides near where the administrative tent has been set up and sell the animal fat for much of the same. \n\n\nWhile you do that, David and Marrissa sell the iron ore you've collected and get tools for your new joint business venture. They also register the mine as yours and you find yourself with a few more tools, and a jointly owned pack mule and cart. The three of you go back to your shared cabin and you crash on your cot. As you go to sleep you hear David chattering away at your other roomate Ander. Ignoring that conversation you ease off to sleep.\n"}, "tree": {"(Bit of History about the people of the world.)": {"Return to the story.": {"(Bit of History about the people of the world.)": "END", "First Landing": {"Establishing the settlement": {"Bring the Singhs with you.": {"Take the Singhs prospecting.": {"Start the Singh Donaldson Iron Mine.": "END"}}}}}}}}, {"title": "The Paper", "stories": {"Late Night": " \n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt's late in the night and you\u2019ve been up for the past hour typing a paper for a class.

Being the determined person you are, you must finish- but you\u2019re not even close to being done with the paper. A nice nap would be nice, you thought.

The more you drink, the more energized you feel! You finally get to the ending of your paper. You sigh in relief as you type the last word. As you tidy up the paper you decide to save it. But as you hit the save button, the worst happens. A federal seal mysteriously pops up on your computer screen, blocking you from accessing your computer! A virus! you thought. Now freaking out, you attempt to restart the computer- but to no use the computer does not respond. You suddenly hear a knock at the door, but who could be knocking at 2 AM?! You open the door and to your udder surprise, two tall men are at the door, sporting police badges. You\u2019re going to be arrested! They say nothing to you as they confiscate your laptop and then handcuff you. Looking at them you notice they are not dressed in their official police attire and are donning a pair of dark glasses. You start to realize they are clearly not who they say they are, as they put you in the backseat of a car. What do they want with me? Why do they want my laptop? You think to yourself. As you figure out a way to get out of this mess, one of your handcuffs come loose- a ray of hope! You grab your laptop from the front seat and escape! Into the busy street you go, with the men chasing after you. There\u2019s a taxi on the side of you and the subway just a sprint away. What do you do? *Traffic is heavy*\n\n\nGet in taxi or head to the subway?\n\n\n \n", "Get in taxi": " \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYou get in the taxi and it speeds off. The men are racing behind you on the busy streets. As cars fly left and right you are suddenly stuck in a 5 car pile up! Sandwiched between cars you cannot get out- the back doors are jammed. The men get out of the car with guns and start to shoot at the taxi. You duck to try and dodge the bullets hitting the windows, but a stray hits you in the abdomen. Stricken with pain, your sight is going fuzzy and is starting to go black. As you begin to faint, you see the men leave with your laptop. \n\n\n<< Go back\n", "Head to the subway": "You frantically push through the busy crowds as you run away from the suspicious guys that are tracking you down. With your laptop in hand you head to the nearest subway car, finally escaping them. As you take a sigh of relief you finally sit down. As you plan your next move, you try and see what's wrong with your computer. With no phone and scared to go back home, you ask the person sitting next you if you can borrow their phone- so you can contact the nearest friend you know. The person sitting next you agrees, but as you are on the phone, he glances at your computer and suddenly snatches it from your lap. As the subway car stops, he dashes away. What do you do now?\n\n\n \n", "Get that darn computer!": "Gosh darnit, not again! You now pursue the mystery man who confiscated your laptop down the crowded streets. As you chase after him, you decide to dial 911. To your surprise 911 doesn\u2019t respond. How can this be? You thought. The mystery man then goes through a door in a dark and empty alleyway. As you go inside, there are 2 doors on each side of you leading down a creepy, damp hall. You see a large wooden baseball bat behind the door. As nothing else will protect you, you have no choice but to arm yourself with the bat. One of the 4 doors will lead you to the mystery man, but which one will you choose?\n\n\n \n", "Door 1": "Door 1: Whoops, wrong door!

And what a strange room it is- the entire place is actually a lab! All sorts of strange devices are all around you, with beams of light and beeping noises extracting from their bodies. You see the mystery man now donning a white lab coat, hooking your computer up to another one of his strange contraptions. What the heck is going on! You thought. The mystery man tells you that your laptop is wanted by aliens from another galaxy and they\u2019ve come down here in disguise to retrieve it- the fake policemen. Aliens?! The laptop\u2019s components contain a resource the aliens need, and that is why they were after you.

The snubflower silently vibrates as they absorb it. You wipe your brow and lean against the hoe, breathing in the peppery air. Well that's enough exercise for one day, you think. With the flick of a switch, you leave it up to the Farmbot 2000 to carry out the rest. Why do they always call it 2000 with these robots? It's not like they had 1999 older models.\n\nYou don't put another thought in it. Time to turn on Galaxy News and see what all those crazy planets are up to. Then maybe hit up a bar, since you can't get a match on NipthmMatches.com. It's not you, it's them.\n\nClick! The digi-screen forms from pinpoints, beading out from all sides of the holographic screen. The light coalesces and a middle-aged newsman appears before you, his face wrinkled in concern.\n\n\"Alert! Alert! Infamous outlaw Raoul Chicharrones was just seen landing a craft only 20 miles away from the city of Hereish. He is a contemptible and dangerous man, known for his bingo gambling scams and underground midget fighting rings!\" A picture of Raoul appears on-screen, with a Spanish complexion in all ways but for a lustrous, thin handlebar stache.\n\n\"The robocam that identified him was destroyed by his own gunfire blast, and from then on, there were no further witnesses. Please do not interact with any suspicious looking characters in the meantime. This story will update in realtime as we-\" the narrator looks away from the camera, talking on mute to someone else. He turns back.\n\n\"Sorry for the interruption, folks, but this is now escalating to a major emergency. A bounty gang called AimFire has declared they will take generalized action if we don't find and hand over Mr. Chicharrones. Rest assured we will engage in negotiations even as we find him. We're confident in this. Thank you, that is all for now. Stay safe.\"\n\nOh, you've heard about AimFire. Who hasn't? They pop up now and then for some high-profile bounties, usually wreaking havoc on everything around to kill their target. Their salaries are paid on a mixture of blasting cities to ruins to kill one guy in it, and massive bribes to not do that. The problem is, United Space doesn't recognize outer planets like Nipthm, and nobody else in the outer planets has the economy to afford those solutions. \"Generalized action\" could be an orbital bombardment with AimFire. There's a lot of caves on Nipthm, so they probably won't send a hit squad.\n\nThis isn't good. Maybe you can do something about it.\n", "Seek and kill Raoul": "Raoul landed very close by; maybe you can catch him yourself. Now you don't sit around on galaxynet a lot, but you know there's a bunch of quacks that practically worship his mustache. Enough that, perhaps, you could say something about it and he'd pause, letting his guard down enough for you to shoot him. Well it's the best plan you've got in case you can't get the drop on him.\n\nYou get on your hovercycle, which whirs at your approach before you even climb aboard. Ooh, this sleek baby was worth every penny from last year's harvest. You've got a pretty standard pistol, but you're a good shot afterall. You could ride to where his craft was shown landing, but he's going to be long gone, and it'll be covered in red tape. No, you need to be one step ahead. Raoul was probably headed to the Easeehid Caverns.\n\nYou ride out from the farm, looking at your white house fade in the rearview mirror. Blue sunlight tints the road and fields in front of you. You zoom past a sign saying NOW LEAVING HEREISH. An hour passes by on the open road, but sure enough, the Easeehid rocks start looming up in the distance, all gray and pink. You used to play in these caves as a kid all the time, when you lived in Thereish, so you know a lot about them. The authorities are probably going to be looking on the side nearest the direction Raoul is coming from. He probably knows this.\n\nYou hover silently on a rolling road to the backside of the formation, far more eroded, and with many more holes to scan. Stepping off the bike, you begin to stalk through the towering eighty foot ferns separating the road from the caves. They end tens of feet before the foot of the rocks, gnarly and withered from the baking heat of midday.\n\nFlip. The thermal scanner picks up nothing so far. You walk forward to the very edge of the ferns. All you see is empty space between you and the first cave, so you run for it. Beep beep beep, the scanner relays through your earbud. Small shadows begin to walk towards you, clicking. Could it be the dreaded Nipthm coyotes?! The clicking increases, and suddenly stops. You want to fire at them, but that'll set them all off at once. Perhaps if you back away slowly, they won't attack.\n", "Back away, fire if necessary": "You back away slowly. As you do, a voice emerges. \"Haha, the matchstick is scared\"\n\n\"Hehe, he walks stupid too,\" another voice jeers. The anonymous crowd breaks into a cacophony of mediocre insults. This can only mean one thing: midgets.\n\n\"Well, well,\" a deep yet oddly effeminate voice calls out from behind them. Even in the faint light that penetrates the mouth of the cave, his mustache stands out exquisitely.\n\n\"Raoul,\" you utter. \"I-I had to find you to see you're amazing handlebar mustache!\" You wipe the welling tears of joy against your sleeves.\n\n\"I don't really care,\" he says indifferently, \"and it's a double-whirl tapered reverse handlebrow. Any true fan would know this.\" Tch-tch! The midgets round up and you realize all that clicking was the sound of weapons being readied.\n\n\"So what's it going to be, are you going to plead? Normally, I wouldn't give a second thought to your life.\"\n", "Plead for Raoul's mercy": "\"Oh, you are a generous man, Raoul!\" You practically want to shave his crusty lip beard off. \"Please do spare me, and I won't mention this again!\" If only you were holding a razor, he'd have the most clean-shaven face around. It'd be a very close shave, maybe with a few deep nicks.\n\n\"Hahaha,\" he laughs merrily. \"Come with me, follow the little folk. I think I have something for you.\" Raoul gently rotates a pistol of his own, which you never saw him draw. \"Don't try anything on the way. I have a few tricks up my sleeve.\" As he says this, the pistol retracts at the end of thin trusses back into the cuff of his jacket. He leads from behind, with the midgets taking point.\n\n\"Haha, this'll be a fun one,\" you hear from the crowd. They descend ever deeper into the cavern. The mottled pink-and-gray turns into gray and darker gray as you work you way down. Is it possible they know where the deep caves are? It's not mapped or publicized, even. And how did Raoul get all these midgets so quickly? You only know about them from a chance encounter as a kid.\n\n\"Perhaps you don't know this,\" Raoul says in his odd delicate baritone voice, \"but these caves are volcanic in origin. There are fumaroles that lead down from just two vertical shafts, into a much wider cavern. That's where we're headed.\"\n\nEveryone begins to squeeze through the tight crawlspace. It occurs to you this would take a lot longer for a company of full-grown men. There are a few places you figured you might get stuck in, but you manage to wiggle your way through somehow. Following the flashlights in front of you, the cavern does seem to open up.\n\nFloodlights are set up around a neat ring filled with sand. Small folding benches encircle the fighting ring, and you can see a few other midgets down here.\n\n\"Flap, this nameless man here is going to do whatever you want him to do,\" Raoul declares to a particularly fat midget. He smiles at you in a most unpleasant way.\n\n\"First day on the job, Matchstick? I know what you get to do. Go up one level with Videk here and find these.\" He produces a black mushroom, its stem twisted up like a dead spider leg. \"These are edible and right now, we need these to lie out of sight for a few days. Those AimFire idiots are probably going to drop some kind of explosive tomorrow, but it won't penetrate all the way down here. So we need all the food we can get. Deal? Deal.\"\n\nIt doesn't look like you have much say. Videk shows up soon enough, sporting a scowl and a hand on his gun at all times. Doesn't look like he trusts you, and he probably shouldn't. You're always sent first ahead, and he keeps the gun drawn.\n\n\"I'm not dealing with bullshit, he says. As soon as we go up this shaft, you're on the ground scraping for mushrooms. These bullets are real social and they'd just love to meet you.\" He sure likes to talk big, but you're wondering if he's the type to fall short on those words. His height already betrays him.\n\nYour arms reach outside the claustrophobically small tunnel, and you're back in the upper levels. You pull yourself up as quickly as possible. A thought passes.\n", "Shoot Viden before he climbs up": "You decide to act on impulse, drawing your weapon to shoot him. BANG! You pull the trigger, catching him in the skull as he tries to reach his own gun. His body quickly ragdolls down the vertical shaft he was climbing, having no braces against the fall. That's going to alert the others really, really quick. You run to fetch a large rock. To your luck you actually find one you can roll over the entrance. They'll probably take some time trying to get through that.\n\nThe best option at the moment is to alert the authorities, now that they have time to come and capture Raoul. Hopefully you'll be lauded as the hero, but most of the credit will probably go to whoever comes in on your call.\n\nYou make your way well outside the cavern to wait for their arrival. Another five minutes later, they show up, asking who you are and what you're doing. You give a brief summary.\n\n\"Thank you, citizen. You've surely done your part. We'll take it over now,\" one of the officers informs you. They begin entering the cave just as you hear a thud resounding throughout. Shouting and commotion ensues; the police cautiously turning corners somewhere within have met resistance. You're still lying low in the trees.\n", "Follow back in now": "The last officer has already made their way through the cave. If you followed into the cave now, Raoul and his gang of midgets wouldn't be expecting it. You begin to stalk back up to the entrance. Thin lines of smoke still waft through the tunnels; the damp smell of rock accompanies it. That thud was probably an explosive to destroy the boulder you rolled over the hole.\n\nWith flashlight off, it's all eyesight in the dark. Turning it on would expose you too quickly. It'd be so nice if you had night vision contacts to see right now. You take a few steps forward, turning to the left where you think the cave turns, all on guesswork. Several feet later, a shoe stamps down on one of the casualties, luckily making no noise. A shimmer catches your attention.\n\nYou can see it, Raoul's mustache. It's faint, but still, the perfect glossiness seems to catch and reflect what little ambient light there is. He shifts a little, and it's gone.\n\nYour gun is still trained on where it was.\n", "Shoot the stache": "You steady the shot. BANG!\n\nInstinctively, you duck and move out of the way from the storm of bullets that would be hitting you now.\n\n\"No, Mr. Twists!\" a deep voice calls out in lament. You fire a few more times at the crowd of midgets, but eventually, a bullet sails through your shoulder, putting an end to that.\n\n\"If we had more time, we'd cut your legs off and make you fight in the ring,\" a mean little voice declares. \"But we don't, so this is how it's going to be...what's going on, hey, what is this gas?\"\n\nParalyzing gas fills the chamber, soon followed by a second wave of police. You think everyone is escorted out, but it's a little fuzzy and hard to tell what's going on. You're aware that you're alive, though, so that's better than you figured.\n\nYou sit up in a bed surrounded by undecorated walls, with a tiled floor. As best you can tell, you're in a hospital. The events of the shoot-out come back to you.\n\n\"He's awake,\" a voice confirms from outside the room. The nurse walks in, followed by an investigations officer, who drills into you for an hour. It looks like he believes your side of the story in the end, and he walks off. You never hear about it again.\n\nRaoul was captured and returned dead to AimFire, who after confirming his identity, left entirely. You returned to the ever-exciting life of farming on an automated farm, more or less content because it's all you've really done, though the adrenaline of the AimFire situation was appealing in a sense. You content yourself with a steady stream of adventure novels on the galaxynet.\n\nYears roll by. You meet Linda, who also works the same kind of occupation. The two of you hit it off over a discussion about hay bailing. No sooner does she move in than she redecorates some of the bland walls, with spicy choices like a Live, Love, Laugh picture. You're happy together, more or less.\n\nTime goes on and on. You have one child named Austin, who never really develops a strong personality. He just goes with the flow, 100% of the time. In other words, he's perfect for this line of work. He'll never get bored.\n\nOn one particular day, sitting on the swinging couch outside, you croak. It wasn't the most interesting life, but it was pretty good, more or less.\n", "Hold your cool": "No, you won't be firing at shadows in the dark. Your patience is rewarded, as you see multiple small shadows, ever so slightly darker than the background, peering out into the daylight. It's only been two minutes, and so far, no backup has arrived.\n\nFor a while, everyone thought that there were other enemies still alive in the cave, and in the ceasefire, nobody was willing to turn on their flashlights. Having reassured themselves a bit, Flap turns on their flashlight, sweeping it across the cave. There's no time for thought. You could shoot where you last saw Raoul, or shoot Flap, but your better senses tell you that both options lead to you becoming a bullet sponge. If anything, escape is your best bet.\n\nThe entrance is so close! You run to duck behind it, creating noise that instantly attracts lights. You're spotted trying to escape just as you round the corner. The entrance is merely 25 feet away, but you'll have to trust yourself on a blind run, or turn and try shooting everyone that comes through.\n", "Play it dangerous": "You turn and brace against the wall, aiming low for chest shots. They come out, a few at once, and you have little trouble gunning them down. Backing up to reach the safety outside works well until they start putting guns around the corner without looking. A few bullets reach you, ten feet from the entrance, lodging into your chest and left leg, causing you to stumble.\n\n\"We need to move fast,\" you hear Raoul order from behind. \"It's time for you to stop moving.\" The last thing you see is the flash of a muzzle pointed at your head.\n", "Remain put": "There's a chance you could take out Raoul from the trees, as long as the hovercycle is in reach. The midgets pour out of the cave like so many evil children, soon followed by Raoul. This is it.\n\nIt's difficult to shoot him in motion, but you try your best to land a shot. Crack! The little figures aim your way and let loose, bullets shredding through the trees. You jump on the hovercycle, accelerating away far faster than they can travel. Looks like you lost them. You can only hope you got Raoul.\n\nNobody gives chase, and you eventually make it onto a speedway headed for home. When you arrive, you practically collapse from exhaustion. You settle into your evening routine and head to sleep a little early.\n\nSirens wake you up, loud and piercing. A broadcast reads aloud from your television: \"Evacuate immediately! AimFire terrorists likely to destroy region!\" It looks like the government of Nipthm wasn't as capable as they thought.\n\nYou glance outside apprehensively. The shadow of a massive spaceship stretches across the sky. Military-grade lasers shoot up from the planet, harmlessly bouncing off its energy shield. A ring in the center of the ship glows, and everything gets real, real bright.\n", "Play it safe": "You think nothing of it. Right now, you've got a ticket out of Raoul's wrath and the destruction of the surface if AimFire is as insane as they're supposed to be. This is really the best opportunity you have, and you don't feel like rolling the dice on whether you live or not is worth it right now.\n\nViden follows up swiftly, and within an hour, you've combed a handful of disgusting, withered mushrooms.\n\n\"Hey, not too shabby. Keep it up,\" he offers. You're watched, but nobody is shackling you in place so far. You count your blessings when you can. As soon as you realize there's a rotating watch, you give up any idea of leaving in the night. You go to sleep in a bare cubby in the wall. Luckily, the government didn't find anyone overnight. Flap draws everyone into a circle (except for Raoul, who apparently spends an hour each morning to manage his mustache.)\n\n\"Okay, here's the deal,\" he says. \"We're going to stay down here and do fuck-all until they hit us. They're going to, I know, because they don't really know where Raoul is. Frankly, we're really lucky that this cave depth is completely unpublished. You can be sure some future investigation is going to encroach on this, so at some point in the future, we're gonna have to move. But right now, plan is to stay low for the day. Got it?\"\n\nEveryone nods (you along with them). It does make some sense. These aren't all senseless minions it seems. You wait in a mix of worry and anticipation, but not for long.\n\nCccccrrrackkk! You hear the deep resonation of shells detonating somewhere aboveground. Some of them land on the cave, creating strong shockwaves you can feel in your feet. By all means, you'd expect the ceiling to collapse on you at any point, but it doesn't. Someone later explains that if the rock was more brittle, it wouldn't spread the impact as well and ironically, the ceiling would collapse without you feeling the vibration. So apparently, that was a good thing.\n\nYou're held under threat of gunfire by a couple of the lackeys while the rest go about checking things. The report comes back in twenty minutes: all stable. The main vent up isn't blocked, though there are some ceiling collapses elsewhere in the upper level.\n\nAfter a day, the operations resume as normal. It looks like they film midgets fighting down in the ring, probably through some kind of encrypted hollowstream, and Raoul shares profits from a gambling table 50/50 with Flap. In fact, Flap turns out to be semi-likeable. Viden, too. Most of the actual fighters just ignore you too often to make acquaintance, but you're really starting to question if it matters much whether you live up there or down here. Flap sets you to a variety of tasks that aren't dangerous and frequently more interesting than the boring life you led as a farmer where bots did everything.\n\nThis is the place where things are really happening. So what's next?\n", "Don't try to change the order": "You're not wont to do anything too hasty. The last time you had one of a thought like this, you decided not to try and blow Viden's head off. Following the straightest path is definitely your kind of style.\n\nAfter about a year, everyone packs up and moves to a new location Raoul scoped out. The inexpensive furniture is just destroyed and disposed of; it's not worth the hassle. The new place is somewhere in a jungle reserve. The planet only has a few, so it's a little tricky to sneak in and set up, but Bonoli has no problem orchestrating it all. Flap died a year ago from some kind of super diabetes. So far, Bonoli's proving to be a competent prick. As soon as everything's set up, with most of the supplies squirreled away against the base of a nearby cliff, the operations resume.\n\nBonoli's rulership is infuriating. He sends you on pointless missions just to keep you busy the full day, dismissing it as a slip of the mind. The little bitch even had you climb a tree \"to scout\" for his amusement.\n", "Fight for a better position": "If you had to deal with this for another year, you'd probably drown yourself. You find a nice evening to approach Raoul. He's been increasingly busy running another bingo scam, so you have to take your chances asking him in person to make the most of his brief visits.\n\n\"Hey Raoul,\" you ask.\n\nHe turns, facing away from the deep blue sunset. \"Oh, hello Matchstick. This is a first. What is it?\"\n\nYou measure your words carefully. \"I feel Bonoli isn't using all of my talents. What other positions do you have?\"\n\nHe looks at you for a second. \"Well, that's a curious concern. Indeed, I haven't seen you doing anything useful of late whenever I've taken to observe. Perhaps it's Bonoli, perhaps it's you. I have the gambling side of things well handled. One thing we always need is a competent smuggler, just to get goods from outside in here without alerting the rangers. You could work with Beatrice on that. How does that sound?\"\n\nYou accept immediately, he returns to staring at the sunset, and you hope this work will be easy enough. It certainly won't be boring! You find a place to sleep.\n\n\"Hey, newbie. Wake up,\" Beatrice says with a light kick. \"This is how it goes. We're going to bike in and out food crates. We'll be cloaked. All you need to do is not crash around in the process, especially through the areas the rangers usually travel through. There's an area along the river that's flat and easy to follow. Just do what I do.\"\n\nYou stand up and see she's making her way to a hovercycle with small gun barrels poking out of the front. You hop up on one yourself, and she adds you to the list of riders on a data pad. It whirs into life.\n\n\"You won't be using those guns. That's the end of everything, including you if you do.\" Beatrice presses a few buttons, suddenly causing her bike to shimmer and fade away, starting from the front, until everything is gone. A jacket flies through the air at you.\n\n\"Put that on,\" she instructs. \"This cloaks you too.\" With everything set in place, you take off at the slowest crawl ever. It takes half an hour to even get out of the jungle area. The tiny, crackling whisper in your ear tells you periodically how close you are to the crates you need to lug back.\n\nYou get to a road and begin drifting along the shoulder at a decent pace. It's only five minutes from here to the crates.\n\nHOOOONK! A massive, extended trailer truck is swerving out of the way of some dumpy little car...and headed for the shoulder. You slam the breaks, narrowly avoiding disaster. Something invisible makes a dent on the side of it. Shit. You slow down and get off to take a look. The scene looks like a shrapnel bomb, with little pieces scattered everywhere. The main chunk of hovercycle is coasting into a tree, far in the distance. Beatrice is nowhere to be seen. You whisper for her on the headset. No response comes back.\n", "Try to find Beatrice": "There's no reason you should abandon your partner to die on the first day. You get off the hovercycle, hoping the cloak will keep going. Half an hour later, you find her dead with a massive bruise where her face met the fern-tree. That's unfortunate.\n\nNot to mention the amount of time that was just wasted. As soon as you get back to the bike, a voice whispers in your ear that the crates had to be moved. Everyone's going to be eating oatmeal for a few days (except Raoul, of course). You get back to the bike, which takes another ten minutes just to find because the cloaking didn't wear off. Soon enough, you're back.\n\nNobody looks happy, especially the squat figure with his arms crossed in front of you. \"Where's the food,\" Bonoli asks.\n\n\"I went looking for Beatrice after a truck slammed into the bike. She's dead. The crates were moved before I could get back there,\" you explain. This doesn't look good. He turns another shade of red.\n\n\"Why you big dumb oaf! I'll have to do it myself now, ugh!\" He stomps a few times, then suddenly goes to bite your ankles!\n\nYou yell out in pain as teeth rip through a few veins. The others try to pry him off, but he's looking to finish the job. As soon as you're on the floor, he's completely lost restraint. He plays a game of angry surgeon with your organs, and you're already unconscious by the time he stabs through your heart.\n", "Accept some losses and complete the crate run": "The food you're picking up is more important to the organization than wasting time confirming a dead body. You manage to reach the destination. It's a small, fenced area with two crates side-by-side, in the shade cast by the side of a storage shed. You can only lug one back with you at a time, but if you go fast through the jungle, you might be able to get the other.\n\nYou get back early, managing to double your speed without drawing attention. Bonoli comes up to you with some clear confusion.\n\n\"I've got one of the crates, and can go back for the other. There was trouble on the road leading to the crates. A truck slammed into Beatrice's hovercycle and sent her flying. She wasn't carrying the crate or anything from here, so I don't think they can link it back to this operation. The crash was a mess of splintered metal. She must be dead from that.\"\n\nBonoli cycles through anger and sadness. \"Damn it all. I believe you, too. I was close with her. Don't go for the oher crate anyway; it's too late to pick it up. If we don't shuffle these around, we'll start leaving a suspicious trail of arrivals and pickups. You'll make an extra trip out for that one later. I need a moment.\" With that, he shuffles away.\n\nYears pass by. You're pretty important to everything, now. Crate runs only happen once every few days, and on the downtime days, Bonoli sets you to a wide variety of tasks. He stopped finding little ways to pick on you, in fact, he became a tad apathetic since the incident. So it's no surprise after a while when he announces he wants to retire. He crowds everyone together to deliver the news one month ahead of time. Then he pulls you aside.\n\n\"Hey Matchstick. You know I'm retiring. I want you to carry out my job when I'm gone. You would get paid money for it. Actual, real money that you can spend on whatever you want. I cut out a month before I leave to train you for it. What do you say?\"\n\nWell, you haven't stuck around this long just to say no. The responsibility is a lot greater, but there's a retirement at the end of this road. You agree and shake hands. He announces you as his replacement, and to your surprise there isn't as much as a grunt against it, even from the fighters you know the least. Everyone has been satisfied with your help.\n\nOver the next month, Bonoli glosses over the jobs and all the moving parts to managing the fighting rings. You know almost everything already; it turns out he wasn't just putting you on random jobs the whole time. He even explains some of the gambling ring details, mainly keeping track of who's fighting who and all the tournament details.\n\nHe bids everyone goodbye when the day comes. Apparently he's going to take a rocket to a place called Disneyplanet, where he'll be trying all the rides in a brand new \"little people friendly\" zone of the theme park. He babbles something about the era of the talls coming to an end, and everyone claps.\n\nYears pass. The entire camp had to be moved again as AimFire was hired a second time to take out Raoul's midget fighting rings; this time to a different planet. It's unreasonably hot on the surface of Vant, but you are getting much better bids now that you're kidnapping midgets off-world and bringing them here to fight. These fights always reign in a much higher amount of coin. All of the old fighters you knew when you first found Raoul are either dead or injured to the point of forced retirement. It's a lonely life on Vant, but you do a good job.\n\nYears and years pass by, and even though it was clearly coming, nobody was ready for Raoul's overnight retirement. He just disappeared one day, with no more than a message about working on his mustache for a galactic competition.\n\nYou start to wonder about training someone else into the organization and retiring. You probably have enough money, and the organization isn't going to last long without someone managing the clients, which sounds like a hassle.\n", "Train and retire": "You check the anonymous accounts. Six digits glint back at you, all in the galactic main currency. Telly is doing a pretty good job. You start to teach her up over the next three months. It's a long and slow process, but eventually the time comes to say goodbye. There's a few sad faces in the crowd; you've become a bit like family to them.\n\nYou get off Vant as soon as you can, but where to? Coaldasfuk looks pretty inviting this time of year. You've forgotten what ice is like; it's time to get reacquainted. From there, who knows. You've got your out and nobody stops you.\n", "Don't retire yet": "Why retire when the most important and lucrative position just opened up? You have no idea about the bingo games, but if you could find clients for the underground fighting rings, you get to keep half of it all (without splitting to the fighters).\n\nYou get into a rocket and blast off for Noghtagratplas, a yellow planet full of people with nothing better to do than bet on midgets fighting. The rocket lands on a sparse plain of stubby little crops, and you step out to the acrid stench of sulphur. The whole planet smells like ass, but you press on. Why do people even live here? Why?\n\nYou don't see roads around here as much as little pieces of concrete over the barren, flat ground to indicate where you should drive. How strong are the sandstorms that they can do that? You walk into a sketchy-looking restaurant and start asking about fighting rings here. A few tips lead you to a red-roofed building, its doors wide open.\n\n\"Hello there,\" a hulking figure greets you. \"What's it going to be today?\" Shunk! He cleaves the head off an oversized rodent and starts to gut it. Hooks decorate the building like a horror movie, each wearing a meat carcass. \"Well?\"\n"}, "tree": {"Farming on Nipthm": {"Seek and kill Raoul": {"Back away, fire if necessary": {"Plead for Raoul's mercy": {"Shoot Viden before he climbs up": {"Follow back in now": {"Shoot the stache": "END", "Hold your cool": {"Sprint for the exit": "END"}}, "Play it dangerous": "END"}, "Hold your cool": "END"}, "Remain put": "END"}, "Play it safe": {"Don't try to change the order": {"Fight for a better position": {"Try to find Beatrice": "END", "Accept some losses and complete the crate run": {"Train and retire": "END", "Don't retire yet": {"\"Nothing, sorry.\"": "END"}}}, "Don't retire yet": "END"}, "Accept some losses and complete the crate run": "END"}}}}}, {"title": "The Robots United", "stories": {"Introduction": "You are an elite robot.

It is the only way to control the aliens.\n\nNOTE : When you do get the sword, you can use it only once a day. But if you are gifted, you might be able to use TWO times. This sword is not strong enough to command a general, but there is one thing about it. After you already use the sword, wait five days. In those five days, don't use the Sword of Tappa. If you follow my instructions carefully, after five days have passed, you can use the Sword of Tappa to command a general.\n\n2. Try to get the Lapis Lazuli, an ancient gem that can be use to destroy the Bloodstone. You must put the Lapis Lazuli into the Sword of Tappa by inserting it into the blade. This can only be done if you are a true person. Not an alien, not a robot, but a person. If you are not a person, you will automatically die. But if you are a true person, there is just a bit of flaw. If you are evil, you will die. If you are a good and honest person, you will be able to insert the Lapis Lazuli into the Sword of Tappa with no problem.\n\n3. After you insert the gem into the sword, you must stab the Bloodstone. BUT! There is another flaw. If you don't stab it in the correct place, you will feel as if you are stabbing yourself. Well, you are. You will die if you don't stab it in the correct place. I can help you for this, but it depends on your courage. There will be a hidden crystal inside the Bloodstone. If you can see it and stab it, you will kill the Bloodstone, along with the aliens, of course. But, if you don't have enough power and you stab the crystal, YOU WILL DIE.\n\nThis is all that I know. The aliens are tracking me down right now, but I must still write. Please, I'm begging you to save our people! It all rests in your hands! Please save the earth, so my life won't be a waste...\n\nCornelius\n\nNow you know the full truth. But..you are a robot.

The main claim was about bringing a better suited learning style for each race separately ( i.e., the Shmorps would get bees as a reward whenever they got a concept right in place of written exams, and Humans would learn like parrots about unimportant stuff, they most likely won't use ever again after school).\n\n\nBut most, at the end, would agree that segregation is a bad idea because Humans and Shmorps would need to learn how to interact with one another when they are all grown up, in order to live properly in the world- So it's best if they would start young.\n\n\nSome people believe, though, that the difference between Human boys and girls is way bigger, so perhaps a segregation gender-wise should be in order. In defense, others would wager just like before, that interacting with girls is necessary when one's all grown up.\n\n\nI would agree with such arguments as more interaction with girls at a young age would decrease the number of average-looking anxiety-ridden people, who write about made up species for fun instead of talking to girls. But that\u2019s irrelevant, of course.\n\n\nOne way or another, Mr. Shmipidu began to tire from answering dumb questions and began to yell at the back row kids who took the golden chance to sow new seeds of chaos by making buzzing bee noises.\n\n\n\"Silence! Hhhmm. As I was saying, today we look at some interactive storytelling to understand history better. Can someone please explain to the rest of the class what is 'interactive storytelling' ?\" Shmip asked with a cleansing look in his eyes.\n\n\nThese retards, Shmip thought to himself. He had a masters in history, with a Shmorpian era specialty. Those stupid councilors at the education ministry don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves. Fucking politicians. Forcing academics to teach third graders before advancing to doctorate! It's pure nonsense.\n\n\n\"Yes Gabriella\" Shmip said enthusiastically.\n\n\n\"I-it's like a s-story, but you can choose and influence it, and then it ends differently!\"\n\n\n\"Exactly, just like life.\" Shmip added.\n\n\n\"And today you are going to live the life of Ezekiel the Mad, who created the first Shmorps and later caused the first Shmorp-humanian revolution\"\n\n\n\"You would face interesting decisions Ezekiel had to make, and you could finally see how small little decisions in history could have a huge effect on the future!\"\n\n\n\"Can I go potty?\" asked Leroy, a human boy that liked to refill his three-litter water bottle every recess.\n\n\n\"What are you hearing me say, Leroy?\" Asked Shmip.\n\n\n\"Errr, I don't know..\" complained Leroy.\n\n\n\"Exactly. So it wouldn't make a difference if you went or stayed, would it?\"\n\n\n\"So can I go already?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, you may go...\" Shmip shrugged. Who knows how this decision would influence the future\u2026\n\n\nAnd so everyone but Leroy opened their Shmorpad\u2019s history class app and clicked on the story.\n\n\n\u201cNow remember class, after you read the story please remember the ending you got so we could later share our experiences with the rest of class. If you find difficult words or have plot questions you can always raise your hand and I\u2019ll try to help. At least until I\u2019ll get my doctorate.\u201d\n", "Ezekiel's dream": "It has been about five years since Ezekiel started his new ambitious project. Some might say even impossible project, most would, actually.\n\n\n\"Science finds a way\" Ezekiel grunted to himself. He was mixing a purple bubbling solution into a thick green solvent, hawkishly watching the result of the reaction.\n\n\n\"Before the Greeks a spherical Earth seemed impossible. Before Newton knowing the movements of the heavens seemed naught but a dream. Before me, Ezekiel Fiddlefide Bronus, creation of new living species would seem like a worthy fiction for a short story!\"\n\n\nBlood-red-puffy smoke emerged from the newly created mixture. It caused Ezekiel to cough violently.\n\n\n\"Maybe with multiple endings...\" he reflected.\n\n\nAt first, he naively tried chimeras. Using limbs from different owners, stitching them together to create fusions of a sort. They never worked out- Each host, treated the transplanted organ as a foreigner, causing a harmful reaction.\n\n\nThen, more subtly Ezekiel tried fertilizing plants of different species with each other. Later, did the same with a variety of animals. This gave him enough nightmare material to last the decade, rarely presenting a healthy result. And even in the good cases, it seems the cells divide into two types. They never truly merged into a fully functioning new type of cells. Although there were cases of symbiotic aid from the cells, in the creation of the creature.\n\n\nAfter that, he tried selecting plants of the same species, with given wanted properties, and bred specially them. He managed to create plants with bigger, riper fruit, but that's about it. It would take too much time to do that with bigger creatures, and he didn't like to do this kind of thing anyway. He didn't want to breed faster horses for some race, and all this line of work started to disgust him.\n\n\n\"There has to be a way\" he reminded himself. The blend now cooled down, placed on the window's ledge. The aimless wind took the remaining smoke with it and left Ezekiel with a flask containing a swooshy liquid.\n\n\nAltering life forms didn't work. Not with the means he has anyway. So now he changed direction- Facilitating the right environment in which new life forms can emerge. The universe managed to do that, and he was a part of the universe... Maybe he would be able to replicate the necessary conditions in which life formed and continue from there. If only he knew what they were....\n\n\nBut he didn't. From the window, Ezekiel could see the entire Tresa forest at its full glory. The autumn complimented the grassy soil generously with brown crispy leaves. They swirled restlessly, sometimes finding their way to the roofs of the nearby village Glenn. Glenn's inhabitants swirled restlessly as well, preparing for a potentially unforgiving winter.\n\n\n\"George, did you fetch our validation mushrooms?\" Ezekiel's voice speared a young man. The man stumbled out from a row of  particularly thick bushes nearby the front gate, and gave Ezekiel a quizzical look.\n\n\n\"You mean the stinkhorns? Are you sure that's necessary?\" He shouted back, with the slightest bit of flinching, barely noticeable from afar.\n\n\n\"Yes, the stinkhorns. And you know why, so you tell me if it's necessary-\" demanded Ezekiel.\n\n\n\"Well, it really isn't sir-\"\n\n\n\"Oh, I've heard enough, just bring them over...\" \n\n\nThe man shrugged, and began collecting the proper equipment for the job.\n\n\n\"You know George, it's true, the saying- Necessity is the mother of creation. You'll just see. You'll all see...\" Ezekiel added sharply, to which George replied with another shrug.\n\n\nAt this point Ezekiel gave up on making his point more mordant and just returned to inspect the potion he held. He sniffed it hesitantly, and began to burst into a fit of uncontrollable sneezes.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes! This could work...\" he mumbled.\n\n\nGeorge set up everything quite quickly, eager to get away from the revolting smell and sight of the mushrooms. This wasn't the reason Ezekiel picked specifically them, but it was a nice unexpected perk.\n\n\nDividing them into control, labeling the group characteristics and documenting the conditions went as smoothly as always. Then came the moment of truth.\n\n\nThe last few months Ezekiel inspected deeply the cell division process. He found that some compounds actually hinder it or accelerate it. Another problem was that sometimes the new cells would keep dividing unstoppably and would behave differently from the other cells. But he would deal with that later. Right now he was trying to accelerate the cell division process even further. He used, it was a crazy idea, but he used a completely different method, that would not even cross the mind of a respectable scientist. But, if it works, future applications of healing wounds, treating sickness, and even slowing age can be a possibility. \n\n\nThis wasn't what he was trying to do in the first place, but one can't just ignore such potential!\n\n\nAlso, if this works, it could make the entire creature creation process faster- by growing life at a faster rate new avenues of experimentation that just took too much time are now possible!\n", "Ezekiel poured the swooshy liquid on the mushrooms.": "Only two drops for starters, Ezekiel decided. From the number of his sneezes earlier he could tell that the new formula was more potent than expected. Motioning George to take his place observing from the makeshift microscope, he began.\n\n\nAlmost immediately something was not right.\n\n\nThe mushrooms began to grow excessively fast. So fast Ezekiel could see changes in the tissue from his naked eye, which wasn't even great at seeing to to begin with. \n\n\n\"Quick! Document the changes!\" He urged George.\n\n\n\"What is the rate? Are there any differences between the cells? Where do they get the resources to multiply so quickly?\"\n\n\n\"Not sure, sir.\" George answered coolly.\n\n\n\"Not sure? Oh give me that!\"\n\n\nLooking down from the microscope, Ezekiel couldn't decide whether to be wide-eyed, or narrow-eyed. There were mostly fungi cells, but also some human skin cells (from sneezing earlier, he wagered). The cells grew and split, and grew and split with no apparent stopping point. \n\n\nA feeling of ecstasy filled Ezekiel's heart, but quickly faded. Something was not right. These things never happen, he never seen any cell multiply at tenth this speed. It was unnatural.\n\n\nEzekiel glanced back at George. All those times when George lacked faith in his endeavors (and in general) can be avenged now, with a simple I told you so. The same goes for the church, and the many cursed colleagues who kicked him out from his previous position. Whatever this is, it was something no one can ignore. It contained power over the living.\n\n\n\"So...\" George said.\n\n\n\"So? So what?\" \n\n\n\"So, it worked.\"\n\n\n\"...Yes, I suppose it did! There'll still be difficulties dealing with cancerous cells and mutations, but the mitosis rate is precisely of the roof.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but how?\" \n\n\n\"I, I don't...no idea...\" Ezekiel mumbled. He can't let the scientific method take credit of the elixir. There's no 'I told you so', not yet anyway.\n\n\n\"I'll continue documenting for the rest of the doses. Go, go make some dinner in the meantime.\" He added.\n\n\nIt was curious. It wasn't any ordinary hypothesis that led Ezekiel to the discovery of the elixir. It was some kind of vague intuition, not based on any facts what so ever. That's one of the main reasons George thought his latest series of experiments had zero merit what so ever, to put it mildly. Not that George ever thought his previous experiments would achieve his grand goal, but at least he had an oscillating local faith that each experiment would help gain some sort of understanding about life. The secrets of life, and how living organisms worked, that's what he wanted to know...\n\n\nBut for Ezekiel It wasn't about gaining knowledge for the sake of knowledge, but knowledge for the sake of changing the world.  And if George went through the things Ezekiel did, he wagered he'd see the light as well. The world is rotten, it needs fixing, that was crystal clear. Humanity is crooked, it needs fixing as well. And fixing brought Ezekiel meaning.\n\n\nAnd so he started to work.\n", "The miracles": "With the new discovery at hand, Ezekiel began thinking about how to make the elixir into an applicable thing. This means reducing danger, unexpected effects, and increasing safety and control. He also had to experiment with elixir's growth effect on different cells, and tumors.\n\n\n\"You're killing them George, I said pour only a little!\" Ez grunted.\n\n\nThe new batch of elixir was almost ready, it was hard to believe almost a month and a half had passed from the first time he created the swooshy liquid. But this time it was a better, safer version. He hoped.\n\n\n\"We'll do it today\" Ez announced, deciding in a moment's notice.\n\n\n\"You think it will work?\" George asked, with genuine curiosity creeping through his voice.\n\n\n\"It's difficult to know if the cells would divide in the right formation, but if it worked separately... I think it would work if the cells naturally know where they should stop dividing and let the other types to divide. A fetus must know how, as well as a sapling, they all take a similar shape at the end of the day, they must know somehow...\"\n\n\nThey advanced through the rough snowy terrain. The Quaking Aspen trees were heavily coated, almost as much as Ezekiel, yet didn't shook nearly as much. The wind simply fondled their necks gently, to which Ez was grateful. His hands trembled as it were without any aid, causing the cursed flask of elixir to nearly slip away every few moments. George on the other hand, held firmly his Forest Axe, and whistled a fine majestic dominant-seven-sharp-nine melody.\n\n\n\"She looks like a fat one, this lady\" Ez pointed to one of the chunkier trees in their view. It was a lonesome pine, old yet sturdy.\n\n\n\"Hrrm.  No need for bad mannerism, we'll cut it all the same.\" George said enthusiastically while hitting the tree, cutting deeply through the lady's thick bark. \n\n\nHalf-way through the process Ez stopped George's thrust. \"That's enough, don't want her to have a chance at revenge.\"\n\n\nThe tree looked pretty unstable, half of the trunk was already cut through, and the wind seemed to grow stronger the wonkier the tree turned.\n\n\nEz battled with the tightly closed flask for a long moment before handing it defeatedly to George. It opened with a loud 'Clack', and dribbled smoothly on the open wooden wound.\n\n\nThe tree immediately began to heal up. The deep hole turned smaller and smaller, though no rings were found on the new patch of rejuvenated cells. After a few minutes the tree looked exactly as before, with the exception of a some missing bark in the area George chopped.\n\n\n\"There you go lady, just like new!\" Ez jumped, the cold didn't bother him at all.\n\n\nGeorge's eyes were full of awe as the both went back to celebrate with a big steamy dinner.\n", "Next miracle": "Four months had already passed since  'Old Samantha' healed up. Ez decided to name her after going on series of checkups to see how the elixir influenced her long-term. But that was just one of the many things he had to do before advancing to the next stage of operation. Animals.\n\n\nSmall and large, slow and fast, but always quite complex. The elixir did poorly with them long term. It often created clumps of cells in places it shouldn't, causing tumors and facilitating a faster rate of mutation. That's why Ezekiel had to experiment with some tissues separately. He found that in some cases, like in cells of the bone marrow, or of a developing embryo, things went more smoothly. These kind of cells divided, and then transformed into a different kind of cell depending on the environment. Certain kinds of solutions also helped reduce the clumping problem.\n\n\nThe spring was at it's peak when Ezekiel documented Samantha's leaves to the song of the returning swallows. A new branch had grew where George had cut, it looked strong and rejuvenated compared to the rest of Samantha.\n\n\nHowever, to Ezekiel's surprise,  the bark and leaves had the slightest difference up close in shape and color. A puffy looking swallow stood on the branch, looking particularly brave. Ezekiel wondered. It's one thing to grow a strong branch, another to fly.\n\n\nNot a day passed, and George shot the bird through her left wing. It immediately collapsed to the ground, not singing anymore. \n\n\nWith the bone marrow from the broken wing, Ez separated the special kind of cells, and applied the right solution in addition to the elixir. The results were marvelous.\n\n\nAfter a hour the swallow was back to dancing and tweeting merrily around the rusty iron cage Ez locked her in. After a few days it regrew all of its feathers, which turned bright yellow. Opening the cage, Ez saw the bird fly away to the horizon. The assymetric distribution of color blended to a dot, and then disappeared in the distance.\n\n\n\"It works so well. I think It's time for the next phase!\" George said while munching on roast duck.\n\n\nEz shifted uncomfortably in his seat. George had found it fascinating to see how the elixir effected different tissues, but to move to humans already?\n\n\n\"No. Not yet.\"\n\n\n\"Why? I thought that's what you wanted. This will definitely pack a punch to your colleagues... and the church...\" George shared between bites.\n\n\nEz looked at his untouched roast duck, the rich smell filled his lungs. \"You know the feeling, when you longed for something for so long? But then, when you have it, you discover it's bullshit?\"\n\n\n\"No, because I know what I want. I base my wants on things I know will make my happy, from my current data, built from past experiences.\"\n\n\n\"But you could change! And one can't accurately compare his experiences to that of a different person.\"\n\n\n\"Some parts of you stay the same, I take the experiences relevant to the part of me that is always there, and base upon them my concept of happiness.\"\n\n\n\"well, that framework of how you find happiness may change as well, one day. You can never know.\"\n\n\n\"Oh just decide what you want, and go for it. I guess I don't care that much, as long as it would bring new insights about life.\n\n\nEzekiel thought about it. The world is crooked, humanity is the worst, at least most of it. That was true. His end goal was creating a better version, more deserving version of people. And now, it could be done!\n\n\nEnhancing the rate of division in embryos means you might be able to grow people outside of the womb. In the right conditions embryo cells can last in an artificially constructed incubator for few days. With the elixir, that's more than enough. And with an increased mutation chance, one could create new kinds of humans. So far, there were mostly healthy results. This could actually work.\n\n\nOn the other side, is he really committing to this? Is this truly what he wants? For all humans to be gone? For a new species to take their place? If he would just publish his findings the world would become a much better place. A future where one can heal from injuries, maybe even disease and old age.\n\n\nBut who is he kidding, armies would use the elixir to win wars, be unkillable. Or use the knowledge to construct weapons of destruction, with the right mutations. Humans who are created specifically for killing, or dying.\n\n\nIf Ez wouldn't take the chance to use the elixir for his own uses, others definitely would. There would be chaos in both cases. The church and his colleagues would get a kick out of it if he would publish his findings though. After all the years of hardship they caused him...\n\n\nThe third option is to not publish, but still abandon these endeavors. Maybe the world isn't ready for this kind of power, but also isn't ready to get wiped out.\n\n\nBut then what would he do? No reason to do science anymore. All those years gone to waste, giving up just when he got actual power over the world.\n\n\nWould he adopt gardening? Yes. That seems fun enough. George wouldn\u2019t like it though. Screw him, he\u2019s as stoic as a pair of boots. He would deal with it somehow.\n\n\n \n", "Continue to humans": "Ez decided. He can't let the whole world know of his findings, and can't ignore them either. This has to be done, this was what he was meant to do. \n\n\nThe next stage of operation was the most difficult, including experimenting on growing rat embryos outside of the womb.  Luckily he found some research already done in that area, done by some weirdo.\n\n\nThe thing was, even if the rat thing worked, Ez had no idea how to expand it to humans, and to find a reliable way to get human embryos. The guy that experimented on rats also found that when some hormones are injected, there was an accelerated production of eggs in the ovaries, which was a good thing. He also learned a lot about the environment that is crucial to sustain for a good early development of the embryo.\n\n\nEz and George designed a small isolated tank, it measured the state of development, and applied the right environment according to the feedback from the developing fetus. It had to examine many important parameters. It also had to react quickly due to the fast growth rate the elixir felicitated. This all thing would not work without the elixir, everyone who tried this until now managed at most for the cells to survive for a few days.\n\n\nMonths passed, and Ez was beginning to regret not being a woman. They made a new rat species. It took countless of experiments, but it worked. They were bigger, smarter, and had a thick jacket of bright yellow fur.  \n\n\nBut now it means collecting human eggs, and experimenting on unborn kids. Two things that made Ez question this all thing all over again. Should he settle with rats, and breed them to become more intelligent, or go forth with the plan?\n\n\n \n", "Stay with rats": "Why advance to humans? A new race of big rats sounds like a blast. That was at least Ezekiel's rational when weighing the options.\n\n\nThe first few that were successful seemed to grow fast passively as well. Just like Samantha continued to grow the extra branch. But that also meant they were constantly hungry. And they didn't eat sunshine. For some particular reason they developed a keen hunger for red meat, which Ez  thought nothing of at the time. \n\n\nBusiness went as usual. There were now Freddy, Bretta, Digroy, and Johnson. Obviously all the rats were named after past colleagues Ezekiel still utterly despised. The plan was to try to breed them with good will and genes and make them a better cooler race than humans. One the universe can appreciate. They will be better versions of his colleagues!\n\n\nOne brightly lit morning, Freddy escaped. Again, Ez didn't think of it much, Freddy always cut hours at work and left most of it for Ez. Ez was used to it.\n\n\nBut things really began to escalate when they understood he began to breed with regular village rats. Glenn began to complain to themselves about a new rat manifestation. One more durable, and dangerous. Little Phil and Big Paul vouched to anyone that listened that the bunch ate their boots and pet kitty.\n\n\nA week had past and Ez had woken up in the middle of the night. There were screeching noises. The floor seemed weird. More soft than usual. Has George bought a new oriental carpet again?\n\n\nIt was rats, of course. They were all observing their caged yellow cousins until Ez squashed mistakenly a few. They all turned at once. They recalled they were in fact, very very hungry. It was a good desert, after a main dish of Georgian cuisine.\n", "Find a workaround": "One chilly morning, Ezekiel's famous daily forest walk was interrupted by a loud sound. It was a mixture of a yawn and a growl, and it came directly from above.\n\n\nSlowly raising his gaze, Ez saw a large brown bear staring at him. Ez froze. The bear remained still as well, in the middle of climbing a tall tree.\n\n\nThis was not a common thing to see in the area, yet still happened from time to time. And it caught Ez unguarded every single time.\n\n\nThe bear took special interest in Ez when his betraying eyes went on a rage of uncontrollable ticks. There was always something- either sneezing or coughing, shaking or sweating... His body loves to ruin things for him, especially at crucial moments. Ez hated that. Mumbling a curse he took five slow calculated steps back. The bear went back to climbing, probably hoping to find some bee hive, Ez speculated. \n\n\nBut this got him thinking. As much as humans suck he can't just experiment on unborn kids, he first has to know everything works right. It would make him feel much safer, morally speaking, to first test the incubator on half bear-half human hybrids. Physically speaking, probably less. Maybe he should test if the bear has good general mood first.\n\n\n \n", "Make bear-human hybrids": "After carefully catching and anesthetizing the bear (George did most of that), Ezekiel began the process. Firstly, getting eggs from the bear and sperm from paid volunteers from Glenn, and then document the new hybrid form in the incubator.\n\n\nThere wasn't any significant difference at first from the rats, but after a day with the elixir, the fetus died. They still didn't find the right parameters to make the right environment at later stages of development. More experimentation would have to be done. So they experimented.\n\n\n\u201cTake 463, The last one was really beginning to show potential!\u201d Ez remarked.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get you hopes up, could have been a fluke.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe the parameters are closer though in incubator 5, on average they got furthest in development. Set every other one to its parameters and make some variations of the initial state-switching conditions so we could see what are the right conditions for getting the right state.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup, you\u2019re probably right. But there are still outliers in the other incubators which are even more promising. Probably some local truth we\u2019re missing in incubator five, though I agree we should go for average successful cases if we plan for high survivability rate. \u201c\n\n\nSo far they built 14 incubators to speed things up. Things started to slowly improve the more they learned. Until one afternoon it worked.\n\n\nA small hairy humanoid emerged from the tank, and started crying.\n", "Now what?": "It grew fast. Ez never thought much about being a father, but in order to continue with his plans he had to be a great one. Weeks passed before the kid started to mumble word-like growls and crawl around the house. At this point Ez let George name it after his uncle Fredrich, the only living relative Geroge had left, until about a month ago. \n\n\nFredrich's fur began to grow rapidly a month after birth, making him look like a living version of Winnie-the-Pooh. He also started to walk on two legs and began to repeat short words. His favourite was eat, but also think, light and dad.\n\n\nIt was very gratifying for Ez to discover that Fredrich had a particular passion for chess. Each time he made a good move Ez rewarded him with bees, a particular snack he loved.\n\n\nEz knew, that one day Fred would question why he was different, and would want more people like him to exist. It was the plan anyway, so Ez made him more Shmorp brothers.\n\n\nThe word Shmorp was actually an Acronym that George coined for the creatures created in the incubator. It contained a letter from each important parameter the incubator used. That way they could call each version of a creature in a different name and know what parameters they used in its creation, long ago when they still experimented.\n\n\nYears passed, and the Shmorps grew up. They viewed the world in a different way than Ez had imagined. Being not entirely human meant they saw, heard and smelled things differently. Their way of thinking was also unhuman, yet often brilliant. And their varied views on their purpose were also something Ez had to take into account.\n\n\nThey were better than humans, almost at every conceivable parameter. They were something that made the world a better place, and Ez would ensure that when the time comes they would rule the world. But it would take some time until that happens. Maybe with a revolution of sort, sometime in the future.\n", "Publish your work": "Ez took a long look at his journal. Most of the things were already documented there. All he has to do is publish. It might help countless of people. It might also do the opposite at the wrong hands. \n\nHumanity will make of it what she will. He decided. If humanity truly sucks this power would destroy her. If not, it will help her thrive.\n\n\nThat's fair. He won't decide for humanity her future. Karma will decide.\n\n\nAt first there was silence in the science world. Nobody thought anything of the research, probably disregarding it based on Ez's credibility as a scientist. But after a few months, dozens of letters appeared in his mail. Most from prestigious universities and research facilities. They all started to replicate and add to his findings. \n\n\nSoon new elixirs for hospitals and farming appeared, healing the sick and feeding the poor. New optimized ways of elixir creation were discovered, and mass production began.\n\n\nThis was the best outcome, Ez started to question his assumptions about humanity. A lot wanted to make good money by selling the newly developed products, sure, but the outcomes were still great. Maybe humanity is on the right path. Even his colleagues sent letters, they wanted him back. Even the religious fanatics Ez despised supported his cause, and thought it was God's will. \n\n\nEz was sure one day a big war would emerge in Europe for some dumb reason. But even if it would, the good things the elixir brought would surely outweigh the bad. For now, Ez decided to abandon his endeavours and take a long vacation. Travel around the world and explain in scientific conferences about his strange discovery.\n"}, "tree": {"History is fascinating": {"Begin reading": {"Ezekiel poured the swooshy liquid on the mushrooms.": {"The miracles": {"Next miracle": {"Continue to humans": {"Stay with rats": "END", "Find a workaround": {"Test the bear's mood": "END"}}, "Make bear-human hybrids": {"Now what?": "END"}}}}, "Publish your work": "END"}}}}, {"title": "The Title Has Been Abducted by Aliens", "stories": {"Two Minutes Until Probing": "You are awakened by unfamilar language, that's volume of sound tells you it isn't too far away.

The bee plague is here. However, fear not, my tribal brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHe makes one of those dramatic pauses, he loves to practice in front of multiple mirrors in his speeches practice room. Then your dad continues with his famous passionate furor that ignites the hearts of the tribes; \"Our better young warriors will descend into the metal and steel's bowels of the sacred vault to calm the ancients accompanied by an official city wizard to fulfil our sacred alliance!\"\n\nThen, you turn your attention to your company in this private balcony in the tower. beside you, laurel the magician from capital smirk sarcastically looking your father speech from his private hologram screen, and like the entire day you have been escorting him, he remains mostly silent.

That beautiful pale skin typical of the people of the rich city of steel; beyond the radiation storms and the desert of asphalt that are the realm of the tribes.\n\nYou shake your head trying to forget those impure thoughts. He doesn't seem to be the flirting type.\n\nYour father ends up his speech. clamor and shouts of encouragement echo throughout the village made by the metallic bones of old new reno; you head towards the interior of the sacrificial tower penthouse built with the remains of cars and go near your father: \"Great speech father. I am very proud that you have chosen me to ...\" your father frowns his single thick brow again, giving him an even more simian appearance \"Flamboyant, flummery!

You think while look the perfect smooth hands and nails laurel has. He finally is well enough to answer to your response, in the last elevator: \"No. We use cars or amu-droids\"\n\n\nIn your squad hangar, you can turn your eyes on the powerful engine of babieca your Harley Davidson with handmade plated armour and two propulsion system nuclear power engine.\n\nTibba, you're second in command, run in, sweating profusely with his gunner armour already on:\n\"Pff, is the wizard still here? Don't tell me the baby is going to accompany us to fight the waxers?!\"\n\n\"Waxers? Laurel asks, to your surprise he seems genuinely interested in the term.\n\nYou cut your second's complaints by raising your hand. Tibba can be a very good officer, but his big mouth is going to be his downfall: \"Laurel, waxers are the name of the people addicted to the red honey. They become mind-controlled by the hive mind. Normally, they are not dangerous, except now when they explode, becoming a toxic chemical swarming of bots. And Tibba, we are his caretakers. Father asked me not to lose sight of him at any time, no matter what happens. So, the magician is coming to war!\"\n\nYour second peeks at him with clear contempt. \"At least you will know what the nano bees plague is and how it's created and put that in your city sacred book. What is its name?\"\n\n\"City hearts\" he just mumbles, he seems to be a believer in the citadel science and just starts to convey the city heart, \"When a human being is infected for 4 years it is asymptomatic, except the sex-driven tendencies and pheromones more attractive spreading the infection after that time, the fever takes over and they collapse and their bodies and organs burst.\"\n\n\"They are half organic, half metallics nanobots, bees, they arise attacking humans without mercy in order of eating them and creating their beehives and their special blood honey,\" you add.\n\n\"Put the helmet on, mage! We are going for a wild ride.\" Tibba just squeals, thinking about the incoming battle: \"The plasma machine gun platform sidecar is now attached to Babieca, boss.\"\n\nYou hop into Babieca followed by Laurel reading his spells.\n\n\"Let's the party start it!\"\n", "Preparation for the battle": "You walk out the door protected by shields of the hangar, entering fully into the pure whirlwind of war. The smell of shrapnel makes you feel at home.\n\nThe massive purring of plasma turrets defending the great wall of energy and nuclear generators makes you feel somewhat safe. You watch shrewdly as the magician's gaze focuses on them with narrowed eyes; they are praying to the Goat mother, trying to obtain her blessing towards the generators, so they don't get destroyed. Without them, we are all as good as dead.\n\nTibba yells into his microphone, pulling you out of your meditations: \"Hey, boss, how about you stop looking at the magician, and give us our orders!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Tibba. You know how I get to be a philosopher before battles.\" you carelessly comment more for your men than for your second. You've known Tibba since you both ran in diapers around the base of the tower. But heck! Some days you would rather prefer that your second was mute.\n\nYour second laugh out loud \"Before battles you start to meditate like a monk, and then warm like a hare, eh?\"\n\n\"We work hard and we play hard, you are not a nun either, second.\" the laughs are chanted by your entire squad of 12 bikes.\n\nAfter saying this, you take a deep breath trying to decide what behavior your unit is going to take. The defenses are solid, and the mutant hives are not really dangerous for the tribal nucleus yet.\n\nYou can strengthen them in case a horde really prepares to attack. But you can also launch a bolt of lightning march your motorized unit is the fastest of the tribes. If you can kill or harm a queen. The horde will be destroyed before becoming dangerous.\n\nYou sigh, your father hates the mere mention of it, but like your mother, you have magical powers. Instead of channeling powers of nature like most of the city's magicians. You can control the technology and the metal around you, using that to your advantage, to decide the course of the battle.\n\n\nTibba for once is addressed to you by your private comlink. \"Are you okay, Brit? I know how much using your magic drains you. We can do it without you need to use your powers.\" Tibba worried asks with a sweet tone; something strange in your mouthful childhood companion.\n\n\"Who are you caring soul, and what have you done with Tibba?\" you soften your own chuckle. \"Thanks for your concern, old bear. I can do it.\"\n\nYou approach the barrier, glimpsing for the first time how the immense infantry and artillery defense handle the zombie horde.\n\nThe plasma cannons and laser beam turrets are annihilating the closest waxers like mummies about to explode. The first giant wasps begin to hatch in nasty hordes.\n\nYou have at your disposal the fiercest elite biker motorized artillery and the 5 missile launchers tanks.

You take a look at your surroundings in an effort to try to find out where you are. The walls are made of red bricks and look like they're about to give. The floor is made of a rusty metal. The entire room is dimly lit by a few gas lamps that give life to a red glow in their vicinity. There are a few windows, but they are so covered in dust that you need to squint with your nose against the glass to catch even the slightest glimpse of the hot desert sun. Looking around the room more, you see barstools lining up in front of a makeshift bar counter, made of a few office desks standing next to one another. The room is almost empty of life at this time, except for you, a bartender with a green mohawk and only the left half of his nose still attached to his face, and two members of the ''Red Jackals'', an outlaw motorcycle gang with a strong presence in this area, infamous for their brutal and cannibalistic nature.\n\n\nYou shortly remember where you are, and how you ended up here. You were born in Castle City, a place quite far from these parts, way up north, which used to be a maximum security prison in the Old World. Your parents were arrested and executed for counterfeiting coins when you were eight, and you were forced on the streets to beg and steal to survive. Just a few weeks after reaching the age of fourteen, you caught the attention of a few members of ''the Warlords'', a nomadic gang of outlaw warriors that were well-known for their cruel nature, including setting entire towns on fire and shooting anyone who tried to escape the flames. You were walking along the bad part of Castle City one night, when a member of the Warlords tripped you, causing you to fall. He and his group started laughing. Filled with anger, you stood up, withdrew your concealed pocket knife and repeatedly stabbed him in the chest, causing him to choke on his own blood and drop dead within seconds. You expected the others to kill you then and there, but instead, they offered you a chance to join them, mentioning that your ''sadistic nature'' suits their gang really well. Since then, you've been roaming with them from place to place, preying on caravans, small towns and a couple of times even entire cities.\n\n\nLast night, you and many others of your brothers-in-arms decided to get some drinks at the Pit Stop, a bar in the middle of the Great Southern Wasteland, next to an abandoned caravan route, which welcomes all types of outlaws with open arms. You over-indulged, and half-remember dropping to the ground and hearing the laughter of your comrades in the background as you fell into unconsciousness.\n\n\nYou head on outside, looking around the front and eventually find your war motorcycle, although none of the vehicles of your fellow Warlords are around. Hopping on it, you decide to go to...\n", "... the last place the Warlords set up camp.": "You begin riding towards the place you remember the Warlords last set up camp a week ago. After a couple of hours of travelling east on your war bike, you reach the camp site. Dismembered corpses of traders and travellers alike litter the sides of the road, a sight often seen wherever the Warlords decide to settle down for a while.\n\n\n''Fuck... It was to be expected, though...'' you mutter as all that remains as a reminder that the Warlords have ever been here is a huge pile of ashes on the ground from the campfire you kept lit non-stop, and the ground full of empty, broken bottles of various types of booze.\n\n\n''Where the hell did they go...'' you ask yourself.\n\n\nThen, you notice it. A skull on a stake in the middle of what used to be your temporary camp. You approach it, assuming it has some kind of message, and your assumption proves correct. Leaning in, you notice someone used a knife to carve a message on the skull. You start reading it.\n\n\n''To any o' y'all stragglers, we headed to New Hope to lay low a bit 'til the Legion passes by.'', it reads.\n\n\n''The Legion? Since when do they come around these parts?'' you question the skull, as if it could answer.\n\n\nThe Legion is a mercenary army, thousands strong, that is being hired mostly to take part in wars between factions, but during times of peace, is also hired to go after bandits preying on the caravans and smaller settlements, usually by city-states.\n", "Towards New Hope": "You set out riding towards New Hope. You pass by a few camps belonging to some smaller outlaw bands, but most of them seem to be packing up and getting ready to leave. You stop at one of the camps to get a refill for your motorcycle's gas tank. While one of the bandits is filling your tank up, you make small talk with him, iron coins ready in your hand to pay him for the fuel afterwards.\n\n\n''So, why are y'all leaving?'' you ask.\n\n\n''Those mercs haven't got any wars to fight in, so they're taking any jobs they can... One of them is to kill all bandits they can find around here.'' he answers, not looking up from the hose he's using to fill your tank.\n\n\n''You mean the Legion?''\n\n\n''Yeah...'' he answers, pulling the hose out of the tank and closing the tank's hatch, holding an open hand in front of you. You pay him and go on your way.\n\n\nThe Inferno Road:\n\n\nYou ride along the Inferno Road, which barely resembles the glorious highway it's said it once was during the Old World. Abandoned vehicles litter it's sides, the cracks in the asphalt so large that if you fill them with water, a family of four could survive for several weeks assuming they had food and shelter as well.\n\n\nLooking in your mirror, you notice a Hummer flying a flag depicting a skull and two crossed M4A1's approaching at increasing speed. It's a Legion vehicle. As it gets closer, you notice there are only two people in the Hummer: the driver and a passenger holding an MP5 sub-machine gun.\n\n\nThey open fire, and a bullet whizzes just a few millimeters by your left ear.\n\n\n''Alright, motherfuckers! Let's play!'' you yell, keeping your left hand on the handlebar and using your right hand to grab a hold of your Uzzi.\n", "Shoot the driver": "You look in front of you, making sure you won't hit anything and that the road is clear, before you turn around briefly and firing the full clip at the driver of the Hummer. The passenger fires a few more bullets at you, none of them hitting you though, before their vehicle skids out of control and plummets into an abandoned waste oil rig by the side of the road at full speed, blowing both their vehicle and the oil rig up in flames.\n\n\n''Yeeeee-haw!'' you shout, turning back around on your seat and continuing to ride towards New Hope.\n\n\n \n\nNew Hope:\n\n\nYou start seeing the walls of New Hope in the distance. But you also see loads of smoke. And, as you further approach and are now in front of the open gates, you see the bodies of city guards being tossed over the walls out in front of the gate. You look up, curious as to what's happening. That's when you see Rawrock Greveth, one of your most trusted friends from the Warlords. He sees you, waves, and then shouts:\n\n\n''Aether! Where the hell have you been?!? Come join the fun!''\n\n\n''What's going on?'' you ask, shouting.\n\n\n''Warchief Zaden said we needed to take over New Hope and get ready for a siege! We're gonna take the Legion out! It's pure chaos in here, man! Murder, rape, theft... You name it, we do it!'' he finishes, laughing like a maniac.\n\n\n''Where's the Warchief?''\n\n\n''Oh, he's hostin' a party for all of us in the senate building! Plenty o' booze, drugs and women!''\n\n\nYou enter through the gates, and slowly ride towards the center of the city, looking around and noticing all the chaos engulfing the city. You see Warlords killing random people, looting shops and raping women in the middle of the streets, in broad daylight. It also seems that they were able to recruit some of the less law-abiding types around here to join your side. You see a few other Warlords torching buildings with their inhabitants still inside. There seems to be no resistance left, with the citizens of the city that chose not to join the Warlords either dead or dying.\n\n\nYou eventually reach the senate building, and see some Warlords standing guard by the entrance. You stop your motorcycle, hop off and walk inside.\n\n\nLoud heavy metal music is blaring through the speakers that were used during senate meetings to make everyone hear the speeches better. You scan the area for a while, trying to find Warchief Zaden. A lot of Warlords are inside here, drinking in earnest, and a huge orgy is currently occuring in front of you, between your fellow raiders, willing, and not-so-willing female and male inhabitants of New Hope alike.\n\n\nFinally, you find Warchief Zaden, sitting on a makeshift throne made of the corpses of the dead senate members, and admiring the chaos before his eyes.\n\n\nYou kneel down in front of him, speaking up.\n\n\n''Your lordship, I sincerely apologize for being late... What is your bidding?'' you ask.\n\n\nHe smiles, taking a sip from a glass of wine, before answering.\n\n\n''It's all good, warrior... Have your fun, this is a time to celebrate. We are behind safe walls, and the Legion will be easily defeated with us occupying this city. Go on now, enjoy our victory.''\n\n\nYou nod, then stand up and start enjoying your time, however you may wish to do it...\n\n\nTwenty days later...\n\n\n \n\nYou are having your first drink for the day at a bar your gang redecorated with skulls on stakes everywhere, both inside and outside, when a few Warlords all clad in their combat gear and carrying assault rifles burst inside unannounced.\n\n\n''Everyone to the walls! The Legion's here!'' one of them shouts, before everyone gets up from their seats and scrambles to the walls. You follow suit, after making sure your new M4A1 carbine is fully loaded and you have spare magazines in your pockets.\n\n\nReaching the top of the wall, you see that the Legionnaires have surrounded the city walls. There must be one thousand of them at the very least. The fighting has not started yet, and both sides nervously aim their weapons at one-another. Until, out of nowhere, Warchief Zaden comes up with one grenade launcher on each shoulder, firing both at two armored buses of the Legion, blowing both of them up, along with the Legionnaires in them. Your side begins firing right after that, with the Legion retaliating quickly, too.\n\n\nAs you shoot at the Legionnaires surrounding your walls, you notice a few of them trying to scale the walls. It looks like none of your brothers-in-arms saw them yet.\n\n\n \n", "Shoot the ones trying to scale the walls": "You quickly switch your targets, firing at the Legionnaires trying to scale the walls. You manage to take them all down, and Chieftain Zaden himself gives you a thumbs up. You feel a smile creeping up your face, and then darkness follows right away. You've been shot by a Legion sniper, splattering your brains over a few of your fellow Warlords.\n", "Keep shooting at the ones at ground level": "You keep firing at the ones down below, and yell at one of your companions that there are a few Legionnaires scaling the walls. He tells the same to others, and soon enough they shoot all of the scaling soldiers down.\n\n\nYou fire most of your clip, and take down quite a lot of Legionnaires. You then spot a Legion sniper hiding behind a truck, aiming directly at you, trying to steady his hands to make an accurate shot. You quickly fire the remainder of your clip at him, hitting him in the neck and watching as blood squirts out of his arteries before he collapses on the ground, devoid of life.\n\n\nYou duck, dodging a few bullets fired by a Legion soldier, and reload your assault rifle. Standing up once more, you continue firing.\n\n\nThe battle rages on for hours, the light of late morning turning into the light of dusk, before you spot the few Legionnaires left making a run for it towards the barren landscape of the Wasteland. You and your comrades don't waste any time, though, and all of you fire relentlessly at the retreating foes, killing all of them. Then, the entirety of the Warlords let out a collective victory yell.\n\n\nWhen you are looking for casualties, you find Chieftain Zaden has died of a gunshot to the head. You don't have that many casualties, maybe only fifty dead, while the Legion lost over a thousand soldiers today. You all mourn the loss of your leader and other dead brothers and burn their corpses in the center of the city, leaving the bodies of the Legionnaires to rot outside the walls. The night is filled with both celebrating and mourning the losses. You indulge in some activities of your choice, and then head off to sleep relatively early compared to your companions.\n\n\nThe following day...\n\n\n \n\nAround noon, when most of the Warlords have finally awakened, you see Callen Steel, your worst enemy inside the gang, holding a speech on top of the watch tower.\n\n\n''... And now, I ask you... Are we, the Warlords, the best warriors to have ever set foot in these forsaken lands?''\n\n\n''Hell yeah!'' a collective shout is heard from down where the crowd of Warlords has gathered to listen.\n\n\n''And did our former glorious Warchief, Zaden, guide us to victory in this battle, or did he not?''\n\n\n''He did!'' shouts the crowd.\n\n\n''Do we want another Warchief like him? One that is fearless, brutal and stands true to his promises?''\n\n\n''Yeah!'' screams the crowd, once again.\n\n\n''Well then, I propose that I, Callen Steel, have proven myself to be quite similar to our beloved former Warchief, and would like to step up as the new Warchief of our war band! Who's with me?''\n\n\n''Chieftain Callen! Chieftain Callen! Chieftain Callen!'' is heard from the crowd.\n\n\nRawrock approaches you, looking at Callen before turning to you and whispering:\n\n\n''You want this asshole to take over? He hates us both, y'know... Gonna have us both killed... Or worse.''\n\n\n''Of course not... What's your point?'' you ask, keeping your voice low.\n\n\n''You can take over yourself if you want, it's not like you'd be a worse Warchief than this son of a bitch. Fuck, I'd support you wholeheartedly, Aether. Just challenge him to a duel for the title of Warchief. A duel to the death, so he doesn't cause any trouble later down the road.''\n\n\n''Why don't you do it?'' you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n''Me? You know me, I ain't leader material... I'd probably lead us all to ruin in about a week.'' he says.\n\n\n''Any other options? Or is this it? I either take over, or we get killed?''\n\n\n''Well, we could run off to that place you're from... Castle City? I doubt anyone will recognize us there. Plus, we both got fat stashes of coins by now, we could retire and live the rest of our lives as rich men.''\n\n\nYou look up, thinking about what to do, and seeing Callen still grinning as he receives acclamations from the crowd below him.\n", "Challenge Callen to a duel": "''Hey, punk!'' you shout, climbing up to where he is standing and drawing your machete out, looking at him. ''You and me, fight to the death! For the title of Warchief!''.\n\n\nHe looks around for a moment, before being handed a machete by another Warlord. He looks at it, and then at you, and then takes a deep breath, his hands noticeably shaking.\n\n\n''Fucking coward...'' you mutter under your breath, getting ready.\n\n\nThe crowd down below cheers you both on, some shouting for you to win, others for Callen. You take a brief look down at the crowd, and notice Rawrock waving at you and whistling. You then turn back and face your opponent.\n\n\nHe charges, and you easily dodge his weak attempt to hit your head with his machete. He loses balance and falls on his back next to the edge of the wall. This could be your chance...\n", "Wait for him to get up before attacking": "He seems not to get up, and instead keeps lying down there. In an attempt to taunt him and make him lose credibility among his supporters, you shout:\n\n\n''What? You died so easy?''\n\n\nBelow, the crowd begins to laugh. Most of his former supporters seem to have started cheering you on instead now, and Callen finally gets up, looking angry, and charges towards you, now with so much speed you barely avoid the hit.\n\n\nBut you do. You avoid the hit, and immediately stab him in the back, causing him to whimper in pain and fall to the ground as you pull the machete out. You then step on his hand, making him unable to use his machete, before digging your own through his neck, decapitating him.\n\n\nYou crouch, picking his head up and tossing it to the crowd below.\n\n\n''This is the one who wanted to lead you!'' you shout. The crowd laughs and you notice a few Warlords begin playing soccer with Callen's severed head. Soon enough, the entire crowd is yelling: ''Warchief Aether! Warchief Aether! Warchief Aether!''.\n\n\n''Y'all are free to do what you like now. Just remember, I will have orders for you real soon. As a second-in-command, I shall appoint Rawrock Greveth.'' you say, after which dismissing the crowd.\n\n\nSenate building, New Hope, four days later...\n\n\n \n\nRawrock approaches you, holding a Cuban cigar between his fingers and taking the occasional puff from it.\n\n\n''Aether, listen... Some of our scouts found the headquarters of the Legion in the area. Their remaining troops are holed up in one of 'em large underground shelters from the Old World.''\n\n\n''I've been thinking of leaving this place... After all, we've been nomads so far, and it worked well enough.'' you answer.\n\n\n''Sure, but think about it, Aether! We're gonna be the first outlaw empire ever! Just think of the possibilities! We could charge tribute from traders and caravans and not even need to rob them, they'll give up their stuff as taxes!''\n\n\n''How many Legionnaires are left in the Great Southern Wasteland?''\n\n\n''A few thousands... I'd think about seven thousand, all of them holed up in that shelter.''\n\n\n''That's one hell of a big shelter, Rawrock.'' you remark.\n\n\n''Yeah, well, it was designed to hold a quarter of the population of Albuquerque.''\n\n\n''The fuck's Albuqu-... Whatever the hell you said?''\n\n\n''It's... Was... A city in the Old World. A huge one at that. You remember Beam City? That place was NOTHING compared to Albuquerque.''\n\n\n''Sounds like child stories to me, but anyway, I guess the shelter is real at least... So, anyone willing to join us on the attack?''\n\n\n''I already spoke to some other gangs. The Skinners, the Red Jackals and the Pioneers are all in. So that brings our numbers to around four thousands total.''\n", "Attack the Legion's headquarters": "''Tell everyone to get ready, and meet up at their shelter. I want the Legionnaires to be hiding inside like rats by the time I get there.'' you order, to which Rawrock nods and runs off.\n\n\n12 hours later, Legion Headquarters:\n\n\n \n\nYou arrive in front of the Legion's headquarters, and already see dismembered corpses of Legionnaires outside on the sand. All of the gangs, including your own, are here, and it looks like they suffered no casualties in taking over the surface. Rawrock spots you and runs in your direction.\n\n\n''Aether, we've done it! Killed a bunch of 'em up here, rest of 'em took refuge down in that shelter! What shall we do?''\n", "Go in and kill everyone of them": "''Everyone, follow me!'' you shout, getting off of your bike and grabbing your M4A1, running down the stairs and descending into the shelter, followed by your troops and allies alike.\n\n\nIn a couple of hours, you take out more than half of the Legionnaires, but them knowing the shelter's layout better, manage to gain the upper hand and surround you and your troops. You fight bravely, but are ultimately defeated. Your own life ends when several grenades are thrown at you while you were hiding in a storage room, and get you blown to pieces.\n", "Collapse the entrance": "You order some of your troops to dump a few truckloads of TNT down the stairs into their shelter, and then several others toss some grenades while you all back off. As it all explodes, the echo is so strong it brings pain to your ears, so you cover them.\n\n\nThe entire entrance, including most of the shelter from what you can hear, collapses in on itself, effectively trapping everyone inside.\n\n\nA few hours later, you all return to New Hope to celebrate. You organize a large feast for the leaders of the Skinners, the Red Jackals and the Pioneers, who are all sitting at the same table with you inside the former senate building of New Hope.\n", "Become official allies with them": "You begin explaining to them the terms of this alliance between all of your gangs.\n\n\n''It's simple, really. If any one of our gangs would be to get into conflict with another faction or gang, all of us would join in and attack our ally's enemy.'' you tell them. After a brief debate, you all settle on the terms proposed by you. You shake hands and each gang goes to attend it's own businesses.\n\n\nMay 2322, Warthunder City:\n\n\nFour years have passed since you ascended to power. New Hope was renamed to Warthunder City, and the Warlords are now twenty thousands strong. Being allied with the other major gangs gives you control over the entirety of the Great Southern Wasteland, forcing caravans to pay you tribute in coins and goods for every trip they take through your territory.\n\n\nJust this morning, you've been poisoned. Someone got a hold of cyanide and put it in your food, but luckily, the dosage wasn't enough to kill you. You're now being treated by one of the few doctors you have. Thinking, you know there were only two other people who were in contact with your breakfast: Jeffrey Ulgreech, the one who prepared it, or Rawrock Greveth, your second-in-command, who requested he personally bring it to you.\n\n\nIt is no question that you need to execute someone, but who?\n", "Kill Jeffrey": "You quickly order some Warlords to go and execute Jeffrey, to which they comply. Drifting off to sleep with the moonlight shining through your window, you wonder if this was the right thing to do...\n\n\nYou soon find out, though, as Rawrock enters your room shortly past midnight and silently puts you out of your misery. You awake just in time to see, and feel, him dragging a scalpel across your throat, causing you to choke on your own blood.\n\n\n''Good night, former Warchief...'' he whispers, smiling mischievously as he sneaks out of the room, making sure he is not heard by anyone.\n", "Kill Rawrock": "''Guards, go and kill Rawrock.'' you order, to which they act confused, but comply nonetheless. They bring him in front of you. Surprisingly, he doesn't try to plead for his life. He just stands there, looking at you until they put a bullet through his head.\n\n\nIn a couple of months, you completely heal and are in good shape once more.\n\n\nYou continue your bloody reign over the Warlords, terrorizing anyone who isn't part of your gang, or allied with you.\n"}, "tree": {"Who are you?": {"Aether Frost, a 21-year-old bandit man": {"... the last place the Warlords set up camp.": {"Go to New Hope.": {"Shoot the driver": {"Shoot the ones trying to scale the walls": "END", "Keep shooting at the ones at ground level": {"Challenge Callen to a duel": {"Attack now!": "END"}}}, "Wait for him to get up before attacking": {"Attack the Legion's headquarters": {"Go in and kill everyone of them": "END", "Collapse the entrance": {"Kill them and take over control of their gangs": "END", "Have him assassinated and purge Hayville": "END"}}, "Become official allies with them": {"Kill Jeffrey": "END", "Kill Rawrock": "END"}}}}, "Wait for him to get up before attacking": "END"}}}}, {"title": "ULYSSES: The Pegasi Incident", "stories": {"Introduction": "    The Federation of Worlds contains six different species' home worlds, with hundreds of colonies, space stations and outposts. For over a hundred years, the six major species (those capable of interstellar travel) have lived in relative peace.\n\n    The F.S.S. Ulysses is a human starship of the Federation Stellar Services, designed to carry out non-military roles, such as scientific exploration, providing medical aid, and performing diplomatic duties. However, the crew have been called to aid the military branch of the Federation Stellar Services on numerous occasions in the past, and while not as heavily armed or armoured as a military cruiser, her twin starship-scale particle cannons still pack quite a punch.\n\nThe story so far:\nA distress call was received at Starbase 14 from Pegasi Station, a mixed-species space station located in Sector 17. All the humans aboard Pegasi Station had fallen ill with a mysterious virus, and the starship Ulysses was quickly dispatched to examine the situation, and hopefully to develop a cure \u2013 before the humans died.\n\nAt the time of the distress call, the non-humans (aliens) at the space station all seemed to be in fine health, and Federation High Command was worried that someone might have created a virus that targeted humans only \u2013 a bio-weapon that could threaten the entire human race!\n\nThe Ulysses was around twenty-four hours away from the space station when the new orders came in, but it was the closest ship. They had orders to reach the space station with all due haste, and they hoped that when they arrived, the humans would still be alive.\n\nHow to read this gamebook:\nIn this gamebook, instead of playing a single character, you decide how numerous characters in the story will react to the situations they are faced with. You will be presented with options of things people say or do, and the story will move forward according to the options you choose.\n", "The Cast": "Main ULYSSES characters:\n\n    Feel free to read about the characters, or use the option link at the bottom of the page to begin the game.    This section lists the main characters that serve aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses, and tells you a little about them.\n\nThe Captain:\nCaptain Jeffrey Donaldson is in his mid forties, and was assigned to the Ulysses following its commissioning two years before the events in this adventure. He is a male human of average height, balding, with a close-trimmed goatee and moustache. His hair is dark brown, beginning to show streaks of grey. This is his second captaincy, his first being aboard the F.S.S. Endeavour for eight years.\n\nThe First Officer:\nCommander Evan Carlson is a human male, in his mid thirties, and had served with Captain Donaldson aboard the F.S.S. Endeavour as First Officer there as well. The captain was so impressed with him; he made a request to have the commander reassigned aboard the Ulysses before its maiden voyage.\n\nThe Chief of Security:\nLieutenant Commander Blake Thomas is a human male, in his mid thirties. He is skilled in many forms of combat, from unarmed, martial arts duelling, to heavy weapons and demolitions devices. He also shares the starship's weapon systems with Lieutenant Lewis, the ship's Chief Helmsman.\n\nWhile he will obey any superior's orders without question, Captain Donaldson has noted Blake's tendency to fight first, and ask questions later. The captain hopes that aboard a non-military starship, in peaceful sectors of space, Blake will learn that sometimes the right words can negate hostilities before fighting becomes necessary.\n\nThe Chief Engineer:\nLieutenant Commander Terrance Idato is a quiet, thoughtful human male, aged in his late thirties. He is more at home among machinery, computers and electronic devices then among his fellow crew mates, but without his skilled mind and hands, it would be impossible to keep the four-hundred and forty metre long starship in top shape.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer:\nLieutenant Commander Susan Anderson, usually just called Doctor Anderson, heads the medical teams aboard the starship Ulysses. She is a human female, aged in her early forties. Doctor Anderson has a powerful intellect, and has taken part in the development of numerous beneficial medical discoveries over the last fifteen years.\n\nThe Counsellor:\nLieutenant Miva Lontira is a female Vesarian, an empathic humanoid species capable of sensing the emotions and intentions of other people. Vesarians were the first species humanity encountered as they began travelling to the stars, and the more advanced Vesarians took on a role of advisers and counsellors to the human race.\n\nMost human starships have a Vesarian aboard in the position of ship's counsellor, aiding humans in their dealings with other beings they encounter.\n\nThe Chief Science Officer:\nLieutenant Johan Gregari is a human male in his mid twenties. He holds a fascination with anything that has yet to be understood by mankind. Lieutenant Gregari has a good understanding of the alien species that are part of the Federation of Worlds, and spends his time learning more about alien technologies and sciences.\n\nThe Chief Helmsman:\nLieutenant Michael Lewis is a human male, in his mid twenties. He pilots the starship, and shares the operation of ship's weapon systems with Blake, the Chief of Security.\n\nThe Chief Navigator:\nEnsign Robert Hobb is a human male, aged in his early twenties, and is in charge of ship navigation. This is the young officer's first tour of duty as an officer aboard a starship, and he hopes to make a good impression on the Captain and his crew.\n\nThe Chief Communications Officer:\nEnsign Sophia Tremane is a human female, aged in her early twenties, and is in charge of communications systems aboard the starship. She is fascinated by languages, and can speak fluently with Vesarians and Cassians in their native tongue. This is her first tour of duty as an officer aboard a starship.\n", "(Section - 3)": "Captain's Log\n\nYear 112 of the Federation, Starday 336.\n\n\nI have received our latest mission details from Admiral Branson. We have been directed to the Banaha System in Sector 17, where the humans aboard Pegasi Station have fallen ill to an unknown virus. It would seem that the other species there are immune to this mystery illness, and we hope that the science bays aboard the Ulysses will help us identify the virus, and with some hope, a cure.\n\nAdmiral Branson has also expressed concern that this virus may in fact be a bio-weapon, targeted against humanity by any one of the hostile species known to the Federation of Worlds. Why humanity alone would be targeted by a bio-weapon is unknown. However, it is a possibility we cannot afford to rule out.\n\nMy crew have seen me through some tough situations in the past two years, and I have every faith in their ability to aid the humans at Pegasi Station, and to get to the heart of this matter. I pray that this space virus is from no malevolent source, for if another species were indeed testing some new type of bio-weapon against humanity, it would certainly be the opening act of a war to come.\n\nEnd Log.\n", "(Section - 17)": "Bridge of the F.S.S. Ulysses\n\n\u201cCaptain, there she is \u2013 Pegasi Station,\u201d Navigator Hobb said, bringing up an image on the main display screen.\n\nCaptain Donaldson leaned forward in his command chair, which was positioned at the back of the Bridge on a slightly raised platform. The position allowed him to look out over the heads of the Bridge crew and their consoles, with a clear view of the large screen.\n\nOn the screen, a slowly spinning object lay ahead of them amid a spray of stars: Pegasi Station. The space station was shaped like two large discs, with a cylindrical structure sandwiched between them.\n\nOn older human stations, the discs would have been rotating wheels that generated gravitational force for the inhabitants. However, over the last hundred years, other species, such as the Nebulons, had introduced many new technologies to humanity \u2013 a key addition being the generation of artificial gravity.\n\nPegasi Station was one such mixed-technology space station, with a large antimatter reactor that provided power for artificial gravity across all station decks.\n", "(Section - 54)": "    Lieutenant Gregari fed some queries into the ship's database, and examined the results. \u201cSir, the station is around fifty-percent human. The other half is an even mix of Vesarians, Buvus and Cassians. There doesn't seem to be any other species assigned to this space station. There should be around one hundred and forty people aboard in total.\u201d\n\nThe crew had plenty of experience with Vesarians, for it was that species that humans were first to encounter, over a hundred years ago. Since that time, the wise, thoughtful species had assigned counsellors to human starships, such as Miva Lontira aboard the Ulysses.\n\nIt was a counsellor's role to advise humans in their dealings with alien races. An added bonus was their natural ability to sense the emotions and intentions of others, though the strength of such empathy varied with different aliens they encountered.\n\nThe Cassians were a feline-looking species, with short-cut, soft, brownish fur, pointy cat-like ears, and a muzzle-like jaw. Many humans referred to them as 'cat people', as Cassian facial features were similar to the various feline animals of earth. Most Cassians seemed to take that as a compliment, having a strong natural affinity for tigers, lions and other large feline earth-animals. It was not uncommon for Cassians to have earth-cats as pets.\n\nHowever, while both Cassians and humans were fellow members of the Federation of Worlds, there was not a lot of interaction between the two home worlds, due to their being on opposite sides of charted space.\n\nThe Buvus were short, stocky beings, who most humans thought of as arrogant and overly blunt. They were often found in positions of bureaucratic government work, as they were extremely efficient, strictly law abiding, and nearly impossible to corrupt.\n", "(Section - 140)": "     Lieutenant Miva Lontira was a Vesarian woman; pale blue-tinted skin, tall and graceful, thin limbed and fragile looking. She was anything but fragile, as the frail looking body hid great strength. However, like all Vesarians, she was trained to solve problems using brains, not brawn.\n\nThe captain had found her to be wise and very helpful in their dealings with other species and cultures. Many times, her ability to sense the feelings and intentions of others had been to great advantage.\n\nThe counsellor directed her mind and heart towards the space station on the main display screen, and opened herself to the universe.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I sense... great fear and confusion. These emotions are coming from the starboard disc of the station. I... I sense nothing at all from the rest of the space station.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all?\u201d Captain Donaldson asked with surprise. \u201cAre we to assume that all one hundred and forty residents of Pegasi Station are currently cramped into the starboard disc section?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d she felt out towards the station again, \u201cI sense a number of people there, but only perhaps fifty or sixty souls. Certainly no more than one hundred.\u201d\n\nThe captain turned to the science officer, who was already pressing buttons on his console. \u201cConfirmed, Captain!\u201d Lieutenant Gregari said worriedly, \u201cI'm only getting life sign readings from the space station's starboard disc.\u201d\n", "(Section - 36)": "     Ensign Sophia Tremane was a promising young officer in her early twenties. She rested one finger against the receiver covering her right ear, as she worked her left hand across the controls of her console.\n\n\u201cPegasi Station, this is the F.S.S. Ulysses, answering your distress call. What is your current situation?\u201d\n\nShe listened for a moment, then tried again.\n\n\u201cNo response, sir,\u201d Ensign Tremane said to the captain, who nodded his head in thought, his face showing growing concern for those aboard the space station.\n"}, "tree": {"Introduction": {"The Cast": {"Captain's Log": {"(Turn to Section 17)": {"\"So, that's Pegasi Station - an impressive piece of technology,\" the captain said. \"Lieutenant Gregari, other than humans, which species inhabit this station?\" (Turn to Section - 54)": {"\u201cCounsellor,\u201d the captain turned to the ship's Vesarian empath, \u201cdo you sense anything unusual aboard the station?\u201d (Turn to Section \u2013 140)": {"\u201cEnsign Tremane,\u201d the captain ordered the young communications officer, \u201chail the station, and ask what the current situation is.\u201d (Turn to Section \u2013 36)": {"\u201cI think we know enough for now,\u201d the captain decided. \u201cCommander Carlson, put together a Task Group.

Out district was the one that got hit...\" \n\n\n\"What?!\" You stared at her, unbelieving. \n\n\nTurns out that it was true. You and Julia was away on a date that day, and you just came out of a restaurant when you saw the light and blacked out. \n\n\nNow where do you go? You lost your family - it was a Sunday - and your home. Who can you possibly rely on, especially when you have freak powers? \n", "Julia's Brother": "\"He's still in the hospital, though.\" Julia reminded you. \"Not sure when he will wake up again. Last time he did, the fire alarm went off.\" \n\n\nYou remembered hearing that weird story. Some guy woke up and started to burn like he spontaneously combusted and the fire alarm went off - no emergency service, though, they are either dead, corrupted, or struggling to make a living in this now quarantined city. Still, you never knew what Julia's big brother was doing out of their house on a Sunday - he is an avid gamer. \n\n\nSo Julia's brother is out of the picture. You can always come back for him, though. What do you do now? \n", "Your sister": "You have no idea where your sister is - she could be anywhere in the worldt. That Sunday she said she was going for a \"walk\", and she took your parents' car with her. Being older and (you admitted shamefully) stronger than you, she bullies and bribed you into not telling your parents. \n\n\nJulia laughed hard. \"You always boasted about beating your older sister in everything, school, games, even strength. Well, guess what? I think your lies just got busted.\" \n\n\n\"Whatever.\" You mumbled and changed the subject. \"What now?\" \n", "Look for a place to stay": "\"We can find a motel...\" Julia whispered after thirty minutes of fruitless search. All of the houses seemed to have furious or scared residents who yelled at us to fuck off. \n\n\n\"We got no money, though.\" I reminded her. \n\n\n\"We can always 'persuade' people to give us money...\" Julia pushed you, winking. \"IF you know what i mean.\" \n", "Say no": "\"No, Julia!\" You scoffed her. \"We can't just rob people. Its wrong, and... Well, we aren't exactly the fighting type.\" \n\n\n\"We have the element of surprise, stupid. Also, these people seem to afraid to cause trouble.\" Julia punched you lightly in the arm. \n\n\n\"Still...\" You had your doubts, but getting money sounded tempting. What now? \n", "Sure...": "'OK! Let's get to it!\" she bounded off, probably already plotting in her head what to do. You sighed and followed her. She can be almost childish sometimes. \n\n\nAn Hour Later \n\n\nYou and Julia were concealed in the shadows, where no one can see you. Julia spotted a woman walking over to your hiding place and you got ready. Once she is close enough, Julia jumped out of the shadows and, feeling bad, you did too. \n\n\n\"Stop!\" She cried, pointing at the woman. \"Give us your money!\" \n\n\nThe next thing hppened so fast it was impossible to follow. The woman, seemingly frail and scared, suddenly pulled a gun out of her handbag and shot Julia through the stomach. Then she turned the barrel on you and, to your eternal shame, you cowered into the wall and she spared you. Putting the pistol back into her bag, she walked away. \n", "Oh shit... Julia's shot!": "You crawled over to her. \n\n\n\"Are you alright?\" What a dumb question. She had blood pumping out of her as an unbelievable rate, and her clothes and the ground are soaked red. \"Oh God, oh God What do i do...\" You whispered to yourself, thinking about any first-aid training or lessons you had. Nothing. \n\n\nThere you are, your girlfriend bleeding to her death and you can't do anything about it. \n\n\nOr can you? You remembered the hospital. But its going to be a five minutes walk, with Julia in you arms. Or you can just care for her the best you can right here, trying to stop the blood flow in any way. \n", "Stay here": "The situation seemed hopeless. And it was, until Julia opened her eyes and mumbled something. \n\n\nStartled and excited, you scrambled closer to hear it. She is trying to repeat it, but it just caused the blood to flow faster. You pressed on the wound but it's too big. \n\n\n\"The light.' You faintly heard her say. \"Move me closer.\" \n\n\nIs this how it must feel like when you die? You wondered. With lights at the end of a tunnel and all that crap? \n\n\n\"Derek!\" She said, a bit more forcibly. \"Do it!\" \n\n\nYou moved her closer, resulting in more bleeding. She is fading away right before your eyes. \n", "Suddenly...": "The light was actually a status light for a electricity box nearby. Currently it glowed blue, signifying that the voltages and currents flowing through it are OK. \n\n\nAnd suddenly the world erupted in a blazing light. \n\n\nThe brilliant white-and-blue light came from the box. Electricity. It must be thousands of watts flowing Julia's outstretched hand, and into your body through her other hand which you were holding. \n\n\nBut it did not harm you. \n\n\nThe light continued to shine, only now you can actually see through the blinding aura, see the miracle being performed right in front of your very eyes. \n\n\nJulia's wound is healing. \n", "No": "\"I'm not doing it, and neither are you.\" You said, now determined. \"It's wrong, and it doesn't mean it's right now after the city has gone to shit.\" \n\n\nJulia's shoulders sagged. \"I know, but... It's not like we can get food without money... Or live somewhere. Maybe we can get money some other way?\" She asked. \n\n\n\"Hmmmmmm....\" You thought. What can be a good way to earn money? \n", "Beg": "\"Actually... Maybe it would work. If you want to sit on the road and wearing perfectly good and clean shirts and shorts. Cause its definitely NOT suspicious.\" \n\n\n\"oh.\" She looked confused for a second, then, \"We can always try!\" \n\n\nAnd she sat down in a corner, made herself look as vulnerable and scared as possible, bowed her heads, and put her hands out in front of her. You had to admit: she got in role pretty quick. But you didn't really want to beg - its still kind of below you, even now. What do you do? \n", "Go with it": "Two hours later, you staggered into a alleyway, almost having to carry Julia. You two were discovered by gang members and beaten up. They also took your hoodies and shoes, reason being that those are hard to come by. Although you don't see how shoes are going to benefit them in the future. What a bunch of dicks. \n\n\n\"Well, that fucking sucked.\" You remarked. \"We should have tried to join a gang. Now we lost the chance.\" \n\n\nJulia cried silently for a few minutes and surprisingly, gathered herself together. \"Our next move is? Get a job, or just wander around, look for some - any - information about Dallion? Or what used to be Dallion. We have to know who is still in control, right?\" \n\n\n\"To kiss their butt so they would take us in? Hell no, girl. But still, you're right.\" Julia rolled her eyes at this. \n", "A job": "You are actually in luck this time. \n\n\nAn engineer invited you over and explained he needed help on his project to return electricity to the city. His colleagues are scattered throughout the city trying to do the same thing, and he needs your help with this one first. He introduced himself as Jeb, and you and Julia did as well. \n\n\nYou accepted the job, but asked for some cash in return. He showed you some and told you to start working. So when he checked and double-checked his machines and plans, you and Julia are down in the sewers crawling in - eew - shit and God knows what. Finally, all dirty, you reached the generator. \n\n\n\"Just find the two green dials side by side. Put them to max and press on the blue button and the yellow button AT THE SAME TIME.\" Jeb's now weak voice came out through the walkie-talkie. \n\n\nThe buttons are on the opposite sides of the generator, so you got on blue while Julia got yellow. You turned the dial and Jeb yelled, \"Hit it now!!\" \n\n\nYou both did, and as soon as you pressed it, a massive electrical current ran through the supposedly electricity-proof button, and into you and Julia's body. The light burned bright and you couldn't see anything, until you felt almost at peace with everything. Is this how I die? You wondered. \n\n\nSuddenly you snapped back into reality. Julia is doubled over, vomiting non-existent food onto the slimy tiles. You did too, and pulled her into you. Strangely, you don't feel tired anymore. Nor does Julia. In fact, she looked energetic. \"I can take on a dinosaur on steroids!!\" She exclaimed. \n\n\n\"Last time I checked, we have neither of them in stock.\" You smiled and checked the communicator. It's fried. \"We're walking back. C'mon.\" \n", "Back on the surface...": "Julia stopped dead before the ladder leading to ground level. \n\n\n\"Derek.\" She said quietly, almost fearfully. \"We are freaks.\" \n\n\n\"No we are not. Let's go.\" You shook your head, confused, and climbed the ladder. She reached out and pulled you down. \"Ouch!\" \n\n\n\"Seriously!\" She yelled, upset now. \"Do you not see how we survived what is possibly a thousand volt of electricity? We should be DEAD. WE ARE NOT DEAD. We aren't normal, D. We're just like my brother.\" \n\n\nYou remembered the fire guy. \n\n\n\"Let's worry about it later.\" \n\n\nBack on the ground, Jeb was happy and relieved to see you ok. \n\n\n\"Dude, I was scared. All power went off and them boom! Everything is back on. And I lost connection and...\" He actually wiped his eyes. He passed you the money and his phone number. \"Call me, man.\" \n", "Mess around, find information": "Night fell. \n\n\nYou and Julia had crashed below an overpass, huddling under a piece of torn tarp cloth. The temperature seemed to have dropped twenty degrees since night came. \n\n\nAll you managed to find is that: Four gangs controlled the city. The North side is claimed by a bunch of rag-tag drug dealers who rose to power, and they have a bunch of superhumans amount their ranks. They are the Rednecks, Signiture color actually being red. \n\n\nThe south is taken by the Families, who wore as much yellow as possible to distinguish themselves. They used to be gangsters - and still are now. \n\n\nThe east side is controlled by the police force. Corrupt, of course, so no way of getting help from them. The still have on them their blue uniforms. \n\n\nLastly, the west side. Possibly the worst one of them all: the government. Marines in green combat uniforms and assault rifles walking the perimeter, arresting anyone who looked suspicious, occationallly shooting someone, and not letting anyone pass.

There was nothing here, and many of them left.\n\n\nMy parents were among those who came, back in '04 to work for UESPA, although they didn't come together. They traveled on separate projects and fell in love on their lunch breaks. U.P. was a nice place then, they said. Everything clean and new, all to attract the best engineers and build the best ships. Io, Ganymede: those were the real goals; Mars was merely a waypoint.\n\n\nThen Colonel Green came in '23 with his delusions of Martian Independence: goons seizing UESPA property, closing access to the launchpads, no one allowed to leave. \"Just like George Washington dumping coffee into San Francisco Bay!\" Green gloated to adoring crowds. \"No taxation, even with representation!\" Thunderous applause, though much of it was canned.\n\n\nMy parents, loyal UESPA employees, went missing soon thereafter.

Your long arms are well accustomed to pummeling your rivals into the dirt. \n\n\nYou stand in the middle of camp. Red Eye lounges on his log throne; his metal eye whirls and clicks, showing him the inscrutable wisdom of the ancients. His muzzle is greying. His fingers idly trace the barrel of his laser-thrower; each mark on the wooden stock represents a dead challenger. His harem groom themselves; the most beautiful females of the tribe, adorned with beads and shells, and kept in reserve.  \n\n\nDeath Mask stirs a cauldron in the centre of camp. The skeletal metal frame, bolted to his face, is inscrutable as always. His eye sockets are dark and empty, taken so that he may see what lies beyond. Metal Sage stares into the cauldron.

They hold his inscrutable tools, which he uses to work his mystical cybernetic trade. \n", "TALK TO DEATH MASK AND METAL SAGE": "You trot over on four legs. Death Mask grunts in acknowledgement, but doesn\u2019t look up from his work. It\u2019s better that he not; like all right-thinking apes, you live in fear of the spirits that haunt this world. Thinking about the spirits sends a chill down your fur. You look to the treeline, and imagine them staring down at you from within the knotted trunks. This is a land rife with ghosts; the Red Wood of Khal Al-Forn, where the ancestors climb invisibly into eternity. \n\n\n\u201cIt has been done before,\u201d Metal Sage says. A tentacle stabs the air, as if to punctuate his sentence. \u201cMy visions confirm it. A great weapon of the ancients, buried in the Grey Lands.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Death Mask says. \u201cThe spirits of steel and stone are your domain. I worry only for the safety of our tribe. The Grey Lands are accursed for a reason.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI can defend myself,\u201d Metal Sage says. \n\n\n\u201cNo man can defend himself from a bullet to the back,\u201d says Death Mask. \n\n\nDeath Mask\u2019s head turns to you. \u201cDo you feel like a warrior, boy?\u201d he drops his ladle and approaches you on all fours. As the tribe\u2019s seer, his body is untouched by cybernetics; even still, his muscles ripple powerfully through his fur. \u201cAre you up to the task?\u201d \n\n\nCuriosity spreads across Metal Sage\u2019s face like a breaking wave. He steps back a few feet. \n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d you say. You pant slightly and puff out your chest. You pull your lips back. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathetic whelpling. You aren\u2019t worth the energy to kill, boy.\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t allow him to speak anymore. You bowl him over and sink your teeth into his shoulder. He howls as he throws you into the dirt. You bring both fists down on the spot where his head was, seconds ago. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that, boy!\u201d his fist connects with your face. You spit out a tooth. You\u2019re in the dirt, now, hazily watching the blood pool from your face. He\u2019s pummeling your back like a drum. You\u2019re sure it will break. \n\n\nYour blood boils. You twist around to face your assailant. As you do, a strange look of excitement passes over his wizened features. You reach out with a leg and wrap your toes around his snout, yanking his head into the dirt with all of your strength.  \n\n\nYou screech in victory as he stumbles back, dazed. You step backwards, before rushing towards your enemy on all fours. At the last instant, you leap forward, putting all your momentum into a double-legged kick. You connect with his torso, sending him sprawling into the dust. Mad with bloodlust, you grab one of the fallen chimp\u2019s legs. Before you can break the knee, cold steel closes around your shoulder and hurls you into the dirt. Metal Sage stands above you. \n\n\n\u201cHow your blood boils!\u201d Death Mask says, standing. His metal face is smeared in dirt and blood.

The ancient stone is so ruptured and ruined that walking on it is a daunting task. Unfortunately, the road leads right into the mouth of the Grey Lands, so it must be followed.

Instead, you sweep your eyes over your surroundings. It\u2019s all blasted flatlands and dead grass, interrupted only by the road.

The ancestors destroyed them with the mighty atom.\u201d He leaves you with that thought as you continue your journey in silence for some time.\n\n\nDays later, you come across a forgotten metal god. A great suit of armour, not dissimilar to the plated suits forged by the gorilla-nomads your tribe has encountered before.  It stands at ten feet tall, with two gargantuan cannons mounted to its arms. It was pointing one of them, before it died. The cockpit is half-open, filled only with dust. \n\n\nMetal Sage bows. You do the same. It regards you coldly. You long to climb inside. \n\n\n\u201cGreat sentinel of the ancients, I bid that you let us pass,\u201d he whispers reverently.\n\n\nYour longing to wield the power of the great machine grows. \u201cWe should strip it,\u201d you whisper. \n\n\nMetal Sage shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s blasphemy, boy. Never worth it to trifle with the spirits.\u201d \n\n\nHis commitment to spiritual purity is infamous.

He gasps as he pitches forward. His metal limbs twitch as they hit the ground with a mighty clang. For good measure, you empty the magazine into his twitching carcass, reducing him to a lump of meat and metal. You toss the rifle aside as you investigate the mech on all fours. \n\n\nAs you climb up its torso and into its head, you feel a great sense of power. These cannons could sunder a whole tribe of gorillas at once. Sitting in the cockpit feels right. An arcane array of switches and buttons stares back at you like the teeth of an apex megacarnivore. \n\n\nYou flick them, on and off, for a time. Eventually, you flick an attractive red switch. You softly hoot and pant as its ancient mechanisms stir to life. \n\n\n\u201cEmergency power engaged,\u201d the machine says.

This is a place that cannot be. This is the realm of the gods. \n\n\nA man stands before you; a human being, a creature from myth. His voice is impossibly loud, though his lips do not move. His face is brighter than a laser, brighter than the sun. \u201cMy son,\u201d he says. \u201cI have need of  you.\u201d \n\n\nYou hoot and whimper as you bow. Surely this being can destroy you with a thought. \n\n\nYou can feel his smile, but you do not see it. Somehow, you know that it\u2019s a wan smile, full of pity. \u201cArise, my son.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d you whisper. \n\n\n\u201cYour ancestors were primitives, but my tribe made you mighty warriors.

Your sensory array informs you that, based on the most recent data, this is a privately owned soy consortium with an impressive yield.

The cockpit shields you from the glare  automatically, the living glass sorting itself into dozens of shaded hexagons. The dirt does not move, it simply ceases to exist in the face of divine vengeance. You incinerate twenty feet of dirt in five seconds, before ancient concrete reveals itself. A bunker; a place where fallen humans practiced fell rituals, the kind that invited the wrath of the ancestors and ended the world. \n\n\nYour lips curl back in disgust as the onboard A.I. auto-translates the red block letters on the concrete.

The Creator revealed these titles to you in a dream, filling you with a hatred most pure. \n\n\nYou punch an armoured hand clear through the surface of the listening post. You peel the concrete off like paper before hurling it like a discus, sending it flying for hundreds of feet. Inside, you see a curious sight: humans. Two adults and two small ones, and one that seems grey and wizened. They stare at you, wide eyed. One of the young ones begins to cry. \n\n\nYou stomp them to red ruin before they can hex you. \n\n\n\u201cYou have done good, my son.

There\u2019s an evil spirit in that one,\u201d Metal Sage says. He skirts around the mech, giving it a wide berth. He eyes it like one might eye a fearsome predator at a watering hole. You follow him. Soon, you\u2019ve both made enough progress down the road that the steel sentinel is just a troubling memory. \n\n\nHours turn into days on the road. Always, your eyes are watchful, waiting for the ambush that never seems to come. Soon, the Grey Lands stand on the horizon. Its dead spires stretch impossibly high in the sky.

The thought is enough to trouble you for some hours. \n\n\nEventually, you come to an intersection of two paths. There\u2019s a high concentration of ancient chariots here; from the looks of it, they slammed into each other at high speed, causing a pile-up of even more chariots. They\u2019re all rusted together, giving the whole scene the appearance of one great metal carcass. \n\n\n\u201cI have seen this spot in my dreams, boy. The weapon of the ancients lies near.

You shriek, startled, and train your weapon at the source of the disturbance. \n\n\nA gorilla on a horse approaches. His left arm has been upgraded with steel exoskeletal bionics, and wires snake over his shoulder and into his spine. Both his eyes are whirring red lenses, not unlike the one used by Red Eye. His horse is similarly upgraded, having been augmented to carry his massive frame. A curved sword hangs at his belt, with a strange battery affixed to the hilt. His head is elaborately wrapped in a scarf, which circles his forehead repeatedly and stands in the air. He dismounts before you. \n\n\nHe nods. \u201cAs-salamu alaykum, brother,\u201d  he says.

He hoots and pants triumphantly, shattering the tension in the air. He emerges from the wreckage, holding the weapon aloft. It\u2019s a large metal tube, with a gun-like firing mechanism.

You both politely decline to submit to Allah, for the time being, but leave the offer open for the future.\n\n\nNo longer do the chimps of your tribe ask. Now, you take. After returning home with a great bounty of cyberware, you and Metal Sage were received as conquering heroes. In the weeks of installation that followed, Metal Sage was able to transform the tribe from jungle primitives to a troupe of finely-honed killing machines. Faster, stronger,  smarter, more deadly. You pour out from the jungle, laying waste to surrounding settlements and demanding outrageous tribute. \n\n\nYou amass your own hoard of weapons, females, and cybernetic augmentation as you plunder your neighbours.\n\n\nWhen one man dies, his implants are removed and placed in his son.

Your injuries heal over the coming weeks, and the only evidence of their passing is a slight limp that you expect to take with you for the rest of your life. You fall into a comfortable routine of drinking water from streams, eating fruit and small game given to you by the forest, and moving on every few weeks. Weeks turn to months, months turn to years. You feel yourself becoming more feral, over time; as the weather starts to turn chilly, you realize that you haven\u2019t spoken aloud in some time. \n\n\nYour comfortable routine is interrupted one day, quite abruptly, by the arrival of the Laserbear . You hear it long before you see it; the beast knocks down trees as it goes, and its territorial bellows send birds scattering for miles. The whine of its main gun cycling, and the devastation it unleashes when fired, shatters the fragile peace of the forest. \n\n\nYou leave your tent and feel the sun on your fur. Using a spear as a walking stick, you set out into the underbrush, perturbed by the ungodly racket that has suddenly destroyed your peace. The first evidence of the beast\u2019s arrival are the ruined trees,  effortlessly upended and flung in all directions. The scorched earth is still smouldering from the beast\u2019s cannon. As you follow the path of destruction, you catch your first glimpse of the beast. A megacarnivore that cannot exist in nature, and yet stands before you. It\u2019s easily the size of two large horses put together. It\u2019s fur is grey and matted, covered in old bullet and laser wounds. Its gun is mounted on its back, and seems like it ought to be mounted on a tank. Its teeth are like knives, its claws are like swords. \n\n\nYou lean on your spear and watch its passing, and wonder what this means for your solitary life in the forest. You do not have to wonder for long, however, as a quick series of hoots interrupts your reverie. \n\n\nYou turn, and find yourself face-to-face with a gargantuan silverback gorilla. Muscles ripple from underneath his wizened fur, and one of his eyes seems to have recently been scratched out. He carries a grenade launcher on a sling, along with a sword of impressive heft. \n\n\n\u201cHail, traveler!\u201d he says.  \n\n\nYou nod. It\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve last spoken that the act feels strange. \n\n\n\u201cI have no name, friend, for I have given it up until my quarry is dead. I\u2019ve been tracking it across the continent, ever since the Sky Father first told me of it in a dream.\u201d \n\n\nYou nod. \u201cSounds like quite a problem.\u201d \n\n\nHe laughs. It\u2019s almost a bellow. \u201cFriend, you don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d\n", "HUNT THE LASERBEAR": "\u201cThis thing is destroying the forest that I live in. We stand a better chance of killing it, together.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re brave, small one. Brave and small,\u201d he says good naturedly. He unslings the grenade launcher and pops the drum magazine out as he inspects how many  it has left.  He casts his eyes up to your weapon. \u201cThat spear won\u2019t do much against our quarry,\u201d the gorilla sticks a massive hand out, expectantly gesturing. You hand him the spear with some reluctance. You watch in fascination as he produces what looks like a small knife, along with a length of wire, and affixes the grenade to the tip of your spear. \n\n\n\u201cWe should ambush it,\u201d you say. You eye your new grenade-spear with some suspicion. \n\n\nHe nods. \u201cYou think like a great hunter, little one. Your kind are good at climbing, no?\u201d \n\n\nYou nod. \n\n\n\u201cHere is the plan, then\u2026\u201d \n\n\n \n\n*** \n\n\n \n\nThe Laserbear comes screaming out of the woods. Its jaws snap in insane frustration as it charges its main gun. It\u2019s in hot pursuit of the nameless silverback, who thunders forward on all fours. He dives into the underbrush as the beast\u2019s cannon superheats a half dozen trees, causing them to explode into sharp wooden fragments. \n\n\nYou watch from a branch, spear in hand. You can see the leaves that you carefully laid out just moments before. The powerful steps of the Laserbear take it closer to the trap with each passing second. You watch as it puts a monstrous paw through the leaves, crushing the small stick that holds the trapping mechanism in place. An instant later, a sharpened log, affixed with animal guts, swings from a tree, ramming the monstrous creature in the guts. Black blood spurts out as it bellows in agony. \n\n\nThe gorilla bursts out of the underbrush, grenade launcher in hand, and fires at the beast. Five rapid-fire explosions send the beast reeling. He tosses his grenade launcher in the dirt, and draws his massive blade. It\u2019s six feet long, easily, and you doubt you could even lift it. He bellows a challenge as the beast surges forward, leaving half its guts behind on the spike. \n\n\nIt\u2019s your time, now. You leap from branch to branch, landing softly behind the bear. It trails intestines and stumbles from blood loss. As fast as your limbs can carry you, you dart forward. It swipes at the gorilla, who parries with his sword, slicing the underside of its paw open. It\u2019s charging it\u2019s cannon, now; this fight will end in seconds if you don\u2019t intervene right now. \n\n\nYou shove your spear into its wound. You feel the blade sink into something important. A second later, the grenade detonates, pulping its insides. It dies instantly.  The beasts liquidfied organs seep out of the log-wound; the grenade was not strong enough to puncture its armoured hide. \n\n\nThe gorilla laughs as he sees the results of your handiwork. His sword has been neatly cut in half, and he tosses the hilt into the underbrush. \n\n\n\u201cI can finally go home,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cAs soon as I behead the beast.\u201d \n\n\nYou nod, and turn to leave. He seizes you, suddenly, with great intensity. You hoot in confusion. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting the hide, small one!\u201d \n\n\nSkinning the beast takes hours. When it\u2019s done, you bid farewell to the gorilla, and wander off into the forest.  Tanning it takes weeks. When you\u2019re done, you have a surprisingly light armoured cloak.  You feel a surprising sense of invincibility as you leave the forest, trekking off into the unknown. \n", "CONTINUE TO BE A HERMIT": "You shake your head, and grunt a bit, before trekking into the undergrowth, as far away from the tracks of the Laserbear as you can manage. Later that night, as you eat a raw fish from the stream, you hear the sound of its terrible cannon discharging, followed by a series of explosions. You wonder if the gorilla triumphed against his quarry, and then think about the matter no longer. \n\n\nYou enjoy your solitude now. The tribe soon becomes a distant memory, as you embrace a life of solitary survival. \n"}, "tree": {"Beginning": {"CAMP": {"TALK TO DEATH MASK AND METAL SAGE": {"THROUGH BLASTED LANDS": {"KILL METAL SAGE AND SIEZE THE POWER OF THE ANCIENTS": {"VISION QUEST": "END"}, "LEAVE IT BE": {"VISITORS": {"ATTACK": "END", "MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PIOUS GORILLA": "END"}}}}, "CHALLENGE RED EYE": {"EXILED": {"HUNT THE LASERBEAR": "END", "CONTINUE TO BE A HERMIT": "END"}}}}}}, {"title": "Who STILL wants to be a Supervillian?", "stories": {"Does it hurt?": "\"You know what I love about first timers?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, while they're getting teleported, they're just a bunch of ripped apart particles.
